(NASDAQ: AUXL), a fully integrated specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Company's submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) requesting approval of XIAFLEX (collagenase clostridium histolyticum, or CCH) for the treatment of two \u00c2\u00a0Dupuytren's contracture (DC) cords concurrently. The PDUFA date for the sBLA filing isOctober 20, 2014.\"This is another important milestone for Auxilium, for XIAFLEX and, importantly, for patients suffering from Dupuytren's contracture, -- specifically those affected by multiple cords causing contracture,\" saidAdrian Adams, Chief Executive Officer and President of Auxilium. \"We believe that a potential label expansion would provide a non-surgical option for treating two cords concurrently during one office procedure and we look forward to our PDUFA date later this year.\"Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive hand disease that can present with multiple collagen \"cords\" that limit finger movement and hand function. It is estimated that 35 to 40 percent of annual surgical procedures in the U.S. are performed to treat more than one DC cord at a time[i]. The sBLA, seeking expansion of the labeling for the concurrent treatment of two \u00c2\u00a0palpable cords, is based on positiveresultsfrom the global, multicenter Phase 3b MULTICORD (MultipleTreatmentInvestigation ofCollagenaseOptimizing theResolution ofDupuytren's) trial, together with data from the Company's earlier studies (AUX-CC-861 and AUX-CC-864). The study also examined efficacy and safety of the finger extension procedure at 24, 48 or 72 hours post injection.XIAFLEX is a biologic approved in the U.S., EU,CanadaandAustraliafor the treatment of adult DC patients with a palpable cord and, in the U.S., for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie's disease (PD) with a palpable plaque and a curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy. XIAFLEX has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. by the FDA for DC and PD.About Dupuytren's ContractureDupuytren's disease is a progressive condition affecting the hand, specifically the layer of tissue just under the skin of the palm and fingers. While this layer of tissue normally contains collagen, in patients with Dupuytren's there is an increase in the amount of collagen produced. Abnormal collagen build-up results in nodule and cord formation that worsens over time. Eventually, rope-like collagen cords may form, thicken and shorten, causing the fingers to be drawn in toward the palm. This thickening and shortening of the Dupuytren's cord can reduce the finger's range of motion (how much a person can move or straighten them). Once the Dupuytren's collagen cord can be felt, it is referred to as a \"palpable cord.\"[ii],[iii]About XIAFLEXXIAFLEX (collagenase clostridium histolyticum, or CCH) is a biologic approved in the U.S., EU,CanadaandAustraliafor the treatment of adult Dupuytren's contracture patients with a palpable cord and, in the U.S. for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie's disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy. XIAFLEX consists of a combination of two subtypes of collagenase, derived from Clostridium histolyticum. Together, the collagenase sub-types are thought to work synergistically to break the bonds of the triple helix collagen structure. XIAFLEX has been granted Orphan status in the U.S. by the FDA for DC and PD. Additionally, CCH is currently being studied in clinical trials in the following collagen-related conditions: frozen shoulder syndrome (Phase 2), cellulite (Phase 2), and lipoma (Phase 2).About Auxilium\u00c2Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a fully integrated specialty biopharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and commercializing innovative products for specialist audiences.

The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) required banks in different provinces to provide solutions on ways to curb shadow banking activities. The cross-sector inspections intend to find out the root problem, even if it will get legal jurisdictions of the banks involved.Chinese lenders, including Agricultural Bank, Bank of Communications, China Merchants and Citic, suspended loans to developers for supplies and constructions until the end of March, or even longer according to news or rumours these days. This may make it harder for developers to refinance maturing bonds and trusts, which could create financial-system risks if there are any. Developers have 33.7 trillion Yuan of offshore bonds. About 6.6 trillion Yuan property trusts may mature in 2014. We know that this group of companies are very active in shadow banking sectors, supported by issuance of large amount of wealth management products.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) also redeemed 450 billion Yuan of reverse repos from banks last week, showing its determination to maintain stable Chinese money markets following January's 23% jump in new loans. The central bank injected the same amount of liquidity during previous two weeks. Reverse repos emerged as the PBOC's key policy tool in managing short-term market liquidity. From the reaction of money markets, investors did not view it negatively, as the 7-day repo rate recently dropped.To view the figure accompanying this press release, please visit the following link:http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/fxp224-F1.pdfSince third quarter last year, we have been talking about relevant regulatory authorities to rectify shadow banking industry, and relevant rumours spread like wildfire. Subsequently it has been exposed by the media on strengthening of shadow banking issues related notice (No. 107 & 108 documents).China's efforts to deleverage its economy may be threatened by a jump in Yuan loans. New Yuan loans surged 23% YoY last month to 1.3 trillion Yuan, helping to boost total outstanding loans to 30 trillion Yuan from 14.3%, possibly because the bank regulator aimed to maintain market funding amid a trust-loan slump. Still, any growth above 14% for all of 1Q could boost the loan-to-GDP growth multiplier to 1.9x from 1.8x in the last two quarters, based on estimated consensus. China's social financing only increased 1.4% YoY in January to 2.6 trillion Yuan. Trust loans tumbled 49% and corporate bonds fell 85%, overshadowing the 23% jump in new loans. Trust loans and bonds' share of social financing also dropped to 5.9% from 17.1% last year. A government clampdown on shadow banking and tight liquidity may weigh on corporate funding this year.The spread between three-month Shibor and Overnight Index Swap has widened to 170 Basis Point (BPS) from 104 BPS three month ago and 115 BPS six months ago because of a surge in Shibor. The interbank rate jumped to 5.6% from 4.65% three month ago and 4.69% six months ago because lenders are asking for higher risk premiums, which suggested concerns about possible insolvencies. The PBOC's acceptance of money-market volatility may heighten these fears.Top news this weekU.S. New Home SalesI expect figures to come in at 400KU.S. Pending Home Sales MoMI expect figures to come in at -7.5%ABOUT FXPRIMUSFXPRIMUSoffers retail traders a level of trade execution, service quality and fund safety that are normally reserved only for the largest investors.

(\"Teuton\") (TSX VENTURE:TUO)(FRANKFURT:TFE)(OTCBB:TEUTF)has commissioned a geological assessment of the Treaty Creek property by E. Kruchkowki, P. Geo. This report is now complete and will be presented to the British Columbia government as part of the Company's submission in regard to Seabridge Gold's proposed construction of twin tunnels through the Treaty Creek property. The tunnels are estimated to be 22.8km long connecting Seabridge Gold's KSM property to their proposed millsite. Of this length, approximately 12.2km will pass through the Treaty Creek property.Mr. Kruchkowski's report details historical work on the Treaty Creek property and also incorporates recent geoscientific investigations on the property and areas to the south by the BC Geological Survey. These investigations include Paper 2014-1, pp 111-140, by J. Nelson and J. Kyba, entitled \"Structural and stratigraphic control of porphyry and related mineralization in the Treaty Glacier - KSM - Brucejack - Stewart trend of western Stikinia\". Nelson and Kyba state that: \"The Treaty Glacier-KSM-Brucejack-Stewart trend is one of the most productive and promising in northwestern British Columbia\".Mr. Kruchkowski, P. Geo., has worked extensively in the Sulphurets-Mitchell valleys as well as Treaty Creek valley. He was involved in the geochemical program that identified the Sulphurets, Snowfield and Iron Cap zones during surveys in the early 1970's (on ground now owned by Seabridge Gold and Pretium Resources). He also located the first gold showings at Brucejack Lake and staked the claims that now host numerous gold deposits. He worked on the Iron Cap Gold zone in 1980 and supervised drilling on the Snowfield zone in 2007. Mr. Kruchkowski, P.Geo., was responsible for the discovery of the Mitchell East zone (Cu-Au) which appears to be the northern extension of the Snowfield zone. He also supervised several work programs on the Treaty Creek property itself, including two drill programs.Excerpts from the Kruchkowski report follow: \"Based on government mapping, the porphyry copper-gold and gold deposits south of the Treaty Creek Property occur in rocks below a major structural feature called the Sulphurets Thrust Fault. This major structural feature trends across the southeast edge of the Treaty Creek claims. As a result, the geology in the northern and northwest portion of the claims below the thrust fault is unknown but may host deposits similar to those found immediately south of the property.\"A twin tunnel called the Mitchell Treaty Tunnel (MTT) has been proposed across some of the Treaty Creek Tenures held by Teuton Resources Corp. The portion on the Teuton Resource Corp claims would be 12.2 km long. The MTT alignment within the Treaty property tenures is approximately underlain by one half Hazelton and Stuhini Group volcanic rocks (southwest portion) and Bowser Group sediments (northeast portion). The geology and mineral occurrences in the southwest portion have affinities to mineralization occurring at the Kerr - Sulphurets - Mitchell - Iron Cap, Snowfield and Brucejack Lake zone areas, approximately 5-10 km to the south- southwest.\"In 2012, a magnetotelluric survey was conducted along the trace of the proposed MTT route. A total of 16 stations roughly 500 metres apart were surveyed over an 8 kilometre length. Results indicate the start of a large resistivity low trending to the south in the area of the Konkin Gold zone towards the Iron Cap copper-gold zone on the adjacent claims. The magnetotelluric survey was terminated at this location and 2 kilometres of Teuton tenures between the Konkin Zone and potential extension of the Iron Cap zone remain un-surveyed.\"The area below the Sulphurets Thrust fault remains unexplored at Treaty Creek. Potential for discovery of additional zones of alteration or mineralization along the MTT below the Sulphurets Trust is considered excellent. It is inconceivable that 13 kilometres of porphyry mineralization along the McTagg anticlinorium abruptly terminates at the claim boundary between the trend of the Kerr- Sulphurets-Mitchell-Iron Cap zones and the Treaty Creek claim boundary.\"Mr.Kruchkowski, P.Geo., recommends that the magnetotelluric survey be completed along the entire MTT route on the Treaty Creek tenures. He also recommends that drill holes 250 metres apart along the 6.1 kilometres of volcanic rocks on the MTT trend be completed, with holes at least 750 - 1000 metres in depth. All drill core recovered should be assayed.The Treaty Creek property is currently the object of litigation between Teuton and its former optionee, American Creek Resources. American Creek is seeking among other things a declaration from the Court that it has earned a 51% interest in the property; Teuton is seeking a declaration that American Creek has forfeited all right and interest in and to the Treaty Creek property. Should Teuton be successful in its arguments it will have a 100% interest in Treaty Creek; if unsuccessful, a 49% interest.The Qualified Person for the purposes of this news release is D.

(\"Canarc\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:CCM)(OTCBB:CRCUF)(DBFrankfurt:CAN)is pleased to announce the signing of a letter of intent (the \"Letter of Intent\") with Pan American Goldfields Ltd. (\"Pan American\") (OTCQX:MXOM) with respect to a business combination whereby Canarc may acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Pan American (the \"Transaction\").The main asset of Pan American is its interest in the La Cieneguita mine properties located in Chihuahua State, Mexico. Pan American, together with its partner operator, Minera Rio Tinto SA de CV (\"MRT\") is in pilot production at its gold-silver mine at La Cieneguita whereby Pan American receives 35% of net cash-flow from production. Subject to due diligence, Canarc and Pan American are of the view that the mine can potentially be modernized and expanded in phases to become a core asset of the combined Company.The Proposed TransactionThe structure of the proposed Transaction remains subject to review and consultation by the parties; however, the Letter of Intent anticipates that Canarc would acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Pan American (the \"Shares\") and that the shareholders of Pan American would receive 0.82 (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of a common share of Canarc and 0.25 of a warrant of Canarc (each whole warrant being a \"Warrant\") for each Share held. The proposed Exchange Ratio implies a 25% premium to the volume weighted average price of the Shares over the last 20 trading days and accounts for the USD to CAD currency conversion. Each Warrant would be exercisable to purchase one common share of Canarc at an exercise price equal to $0.15 for a period of 3 years.Pan American has granted Canarc a 130 day period of exclusivity (the \"Exclusivity Period\") to complete its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement with respect to the Transaction. The Letter of Intent terminates on June 30, 2014 unless terminated earlier by either party as a result of its due diligence.Pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Intent, Canarc has agreed to pay US$100,000 (the \"Funds\") to Pan American, following TSX approval. Pan American has agreed to repay the Funds to Canarc in the event that (a) Canarc terminates the Letter of Intent or determines not to proceed with the Transaction as a result of its due diligence; or (b) Pan American terminates the Letter of Intent or determines not to proceed with the Transaction for any reason.Canarc plans to use commercially reasonable efforts to raise up to US$1.8 million in working capital financing pursuant to a private placement. In the event that the private placement is completed, the parties have agreed to negotiate an interim loan facility (the \"Loan\"). Under the Loan, Canarc would lend Pan American up to a total of US$250,000 prior to closing of the Transaction.Following the completion of the Transaction, Pan American will have the right to nominate two persons to the board of directors of the combined company. The remainder of the board will be nominees of Canarc.The Transaction remains subject to the parties negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement by June 30, 2014. Entering into a definitive agreement with respect to the Transaction will be subject to, among other things: (a) each party being satisfied in its sole discretion as to the results of its due diligence review, and (b) approval of the board of directors of each party. The definitive agreement will include customary provisions and deal protections, including receipt of all necessary consents and approvals, including all required stock exchange and shareholder approvals.The Board of Directors of Canarc and the Strategy Committee of Pan American Board of Directors have approved the proposed transaction.Bradford Cooke, Chairman and Founder of Canarc, commented: \"Today's announcement marks an important step forward that will potentially transition Canarc into a growing gold-silver producer in the near term. The proposed transaction represents a great opportunity for both Canarc and Pan American shareholders to benefit from the combination of Pan American's largely untapped asset at La Cieneguita and Canarc's seasoned management team of mine finders, builders and operators. I believe this is truly an accretive transaction for both Canarc and Pan American shareholders where one plus one equals three.\"Mr. Catalin Chiloflischi, CEO of Canarc, stated: \"I would like to thank the Pan American management team and board of directors for their confidence in our ability to grow the Cieneguita Mexico mine into a profitable producing asset for the benefit of our combined shareholders, stakeholders, employees and the local community at La Cieneguita. We look forward to leveraging our team's mine building and operating expertise in order to transition Canarc into a successful producing gold-silver mining company.\"Mr. Emilio Alvarez, CEO of Pan American said: \"After an extensive review of options following the AGM last year, Pan American believes that the business combination with Canarc will realise the full potential of the La Cieneguita mine project, particularly given the challenging times almost everyone in the junior resource sector is facing.\"Bruno Le Barber, Director and Member of Pan American's Strategy Committee added, \"We are very pleased to partner with the knowledgeable and experienced management team at Canarc. Their Chairman, Mr. Bradford Cooke, is also the founder and CEO of Endeavour Silver, a successful silver mining company with three operating mines in Mexico. He has taken it from a start-up to a significant mid-tier producer within 10 years listed on the TSX and NYSE with a market cap of over $600 million today. We believe that Canarc's ambitious strategy of acquiring production opportunities together with the development of the New Polaris Project in British Colombia will deliver substantial value to Pan American shareholders.\"La Cieneguita HighlightsFour concessions totalling 822 hectares, located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico only 20Km from Goldcorp's El Sauzal mine, with roads and infrastructure in place;Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 509,800 ounces of gold, 37.6 million ounces of silver, 120.1 million pounds of lead and 191.7 pounds of zinc;Inferred Mineral Resources of 352,200 ounces of gold, 21 million ounces of silver, 67.2 million pounds of lead and 111.2 pounds of zinc;Open pit gold-silver mine currently operating at 700 tpd producing gold-silver concentrates since 2010; andThe proposed business combination will maximise Cieneguita's value for both Canarc and Pan American shareholders, with a potential to create a combined company with significant benefits.Canarc has not yet independently verified Pan American's NI 43-101 reserves and resources nor its preliminary economic assessment, available onwww.sedar.com, nor the production numbers and therefore is not relying on them at this stage (see Pan American reserve/resource and PEA NI 43-101 reports on SEDAR). Canarc plans to complete a more detailed assessment of the La Cieneguita reserves and resources, mine operations and plan, and economic performance in order to complete its own NI 43-101 reports and develop its own long term growth plan in order to provide future guidance on reserves and resources, gold and silver production, capital and operating costs, and exploration programs and budgets after closing.Transaction Rationale for CanarcPotential to transition Canarc into a producer over the near term;Near term access to cash flow to facilitate growth;Potential to increase Canarc's total gold equivalent resources; andPotential to grow into a mid-tier gold producer over the medium term.Transaction Rationale for Pan AmericanParticipation by Pan American shareholders in the upside potential of both Pan American's La Cieneguita gold mine project and Canarc's New Polaris gold mine project;Pan American shareholders would own shares in a larger company with two gold projects located in mining favorable jurisdictions (Canada and Mexico);Access to a proven team of mine finders, builders and operators is a key to success at La Cieneguita; andImproved financial standing, significantly improved liquidity and a combined broader access to capital.AdvisorsCanarc retained Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP as its legal advisor.Pan American retained Emerging Markets Capital Limited as its structurer.FinancingCanarc also announces that it is arranging, on a best efforts basis, a private placement to raise up to CA$2.2 million. The private placement will be of up to 22 million units priced at CA$0.10 per unit and may be partially brokered, at the Company's discretion. Each unit will be comprised of one common share and one half of a common share purchase warrant, each full warrant giving the holder the right to purchase one additional common share at a price of CA$0.15 within a three year period. The Company may pay up to 7% commission in cash or units to appropriate brokers and finders for arranging this financing.The aforementioned transaction and private placement are each subject to Toronto Stock Exchange approval. The shares and warrants will be subject to a four month plus one day hold period. The net proceeds of the unit private placement will be used for working capital purposes.Catalin Chiloflischi,CEO,CANARC RESOURCE CORP.Qualified Person- Garry Biles, P.

Supporters in Congress and the energy industry say Keystone would improve U.S. energy security and create thousands of construction jobs.The decision puts Obama in a difficult political spot ahead of the 2014 midterm elections, where Democratic control of the U.S. Senate is at stake.If he approves the project, he risks alienating core Democratic supporters. But denying it will anger labor unions, and could hurt Democratic incumbents in several tight races.Some have speculated Obama could wait until after the November elections to decide, although his comments to Fallin would suggest an earlier ruling.White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to say whether Obama gave Fallin an estimated timeline, and noted the State Department is gathering comments from other government agencies and the public on the $5.4 billion project.\"I don't have a readout and won't have a readout of that conversation,\" Carney told reporters at a briefing after the governors met Obama.The agencies have until the end of April to comment on whether the pipeline is in the national interest.Then Secretary of State John Kerry will make a recommendation to Obama on whether the project is in the national interest. Obama has indicated he will make the ultimate decision.MEANWHILE IN NEBRASKAAnalysts have said a surprise Nebraska court ruling last week also could give Obama a reason to pause his administration's deliberations on the pipeline project.The court ruled that a law that let Governor Dave Heineman allow the Keystone XL project to pass through his state was invalid.That may mean a small agency called the Nebraska Public Service Commission has to review the pipeline's route through the state, which could take several months.But TransCanada said on Monday it was confident that the issue would soon be resolved.Nebraska's state's attorney general immediately appealed the court decision on behalf of Heineman immediately after the court ruled. That appeal puts a hold on the lower court's ruling until a final judgment by a higher court, TransCanada said, based on its discussions with the state.Company spokesman James Millar said TransCanada believes the route approved by Heineman remains valid during the appeal.\"We have dealt with many issues related to this project in the past and are confident we can overcome this latest hurdle,\" Millar said in a statement.(Additional reporting byTimothy Gardnerin Washington andScott Haggettin Calgary; Editing byDavid Storeyand Meredith Mazzilli)"], "2014/02/24/markets-usa-stocks-close-idUSZXN0R3Z2I20140224": ["US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-S&P 500 ends less than 1 point below record close", "2014/02/24", "NEW YORKFeb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday,\nwith the S&P 500 ending less than a point away from a record\nclosing high, helped by gains in health insurers and optimism\nover merger activity.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.84 points\nor 0.64 percent, to end unofficially at 16,207.14.

Justina is at the center of a legal battle between the Pelletier family and Boston Children's Hospital over custody and proper medical treatment.AttorneyMatt Staverof Liberty Counsel filed a motion forpro hac viceto represent the Pelletiers, but the judge took the rare move of allowing the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) to respond to the motion, effectively denying the specialist attorney from arguing in the hearing.To keep the case under wraps, the judge ordered media to leave the courtroom and took the unconscionable step of transferring Justina's custody to the foster care system, where she will not have access to treatment for her mitochondrial disease. Her family is deeply concerned for her life and safety.Boston Children's Hospital performed a controversial medical-legal maneuver colloquially called a \"parent-ectomy\" last year, seizing custody of Justina after disagreeing with her parents and physicians at Tufts Medical Center about her diagnosis and treatment. Since losing custody, Justina's condition has steeply deteriorated.After receiving the judge's shocking decision today, the Pelletier family was heartbroken and distraught at Justina's plight.

Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT)\u00c2\u00a0to mean net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\u00c2\u00a0 Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate the Company's business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income by itself as the primary measure of the Company's operating performance.\u00c2\u00a0 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.\u00c2\u00a0 Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself.FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\u00c2\u00a0 Further, while the Company adheres to the NAREIT definition of FFO, its presentation of FFO is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definition.Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry.\u00c2\u00a0 AFFO further adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP.\u00c2\u00a0 AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.\u00c2\u00a0 Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Company's performance.\u00c2\u00a0 The Company's computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore may not be comparable to such other REITs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2Agree Realty CorporationConsolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands)(Unaudited)December 31,December 31,20132012Assets:Land\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 162,097$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0134,741Buildings297,465240,204Accumulated depreciation(60,634)(58,509)Property under development\u00c26,95918,981Property held for sale4,8454,538Net real estate investments410,732339,955Cash and cash equivalents14,5371,270Accounts receivable\u00c23,2632,160Deferred costs, net of amortization30,99024,895Other assets3,2201,813Total Assets$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 462,742$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0370,093LiabilitiesNotes Payable:Mortgages notes payable$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 113,898$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0117,376Unsecured revolving credit facility9,50043,530Unsecured term loan35,000-Total Notes Payable:158,398160,906Deferred revenue1,4671,931Dividends and distributions payable6,2444,710Other liabilities4,4174,581Total Liabilities170,526172,128Stockholder's EquityCommon stock (14,883,314 and 11,436,044 shares)11Additional paid-in capital312,975217,769Deficit(23,879)(21,167)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)472(1,294)Non-controlling interest2,6472,656Total Stockholder's Equity292,216197,965$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 462,742$ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0370,093\u00c2\u00c2SOURCE  Agree Realty Corporation"]}

So we're going to have to go beyond that,\" he said,\nalthough he gave no details.Reuters reported earlier this month that the Pentagon\nplanned to ask Congress for $4.5 billion in additional funding\nfor missile defense over the next five years, including $560\nmillion for work on a new interceptor after several failed\nflight tests in recent years.The White House plans to send its fiscal 2015 budget request\nto Congress on March 4. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel previewed\nthe Pentagon's portion of the budget on Monday but did not\nprovide specific details about missile defense.Missile defense is one of the biggest items in the\nPentagon's annual budget, although Republicans have faulted the\nObama administration for scaling back funding in recent years.Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin Corp are\nalready working on early designs of a new \"common kill vehicle\",\nthe part of the ground-based interceptor that hits and destroys\nan incoming enemy missile on contact. The new development effort\nwould likely accelerate and expand that program, but details\nhave not been released.Sources familiar with the process say the Pentagon now plans\nto fund development of a new interceptor, specifically the kill\nvehicle.Missile defense experts say that problems with the Raytheon\nkill vehicle stem from the fact that testing and development\nwere not complete when the Bush administration opted to deploy\nsome initial ground-based interceptors.The kill vehicle is part of the larger ground-based missile\ndefense system managed by Boeing, with a rocket built by Orbital\nSciences Corp.Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's chief weapons\ntester, earlier this month questioned the robustness of the\nRaytheon kill vehicle after a series of test failures and said\nthe Pentagon should consider a redesign."], "2014/02/25/us-telekomaustria-slim-idUSBREA1O1OX20140225": ["Slim closes in on pact to secure Telekom Austria", "2014/02/25", "VIENNA(Reuters) - Carlos Slim's America Movil and the Austrian government are moving towards a deal to pool their stakes in Telekom Austria, which would lead to a takeover offer and mark a further step in the Mexican tycoon's expansion in Europe.Austria's economy minister said on Tuesday talks about creating a shareholder pact, which both parties said had been informal so far, could wrap up within weeks.American Movil, which faces increased regulation and competition in Latin America and is looking to expand into a recovering European economy, said on Monday it could move to formal talks with Austria.An alliance would hold 55 percent of Telekom Austria - 28 percent from state holding company OIAG and 27 percent from America Movil - obliging it to make a takeover offer under Austrian law.Telekom Austria shares closed up 1.65 percent, valuing the whole business at more than 3.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion). The stock earlier touched 7.31 euros, the highest since July 2012, two months after Slim made his first decisive move on the company by agreeing to buy 21 percent.Slim's investments in a mature and highly competitive European telecoms market have surprised analysts and are currently loss-making, though some think they could be a canny bet on growth picking up and regulation easing.The Mexican bought most of his current stake in Telekom Austria at 9.50 euros a share.Analysts expect he will become the largest shareholder following any takeover offer for Telekom Austria, but he is eager to secure a friendly deal after his attempt to buy Dutch telecoms group KPN last year was blocked by a KPN foundation that viewed his bid as hostile.Slim's Mexican biographer Jose Martinez told Reuters the telecoms mogul was pursuing a long-term strategy in Europe and said America Movil was still keen to take control of KPN.\"He's going to persist, no doubt about it,\" Martinez said. \"That's his message: he's interested in European markets.\"Some analysts believe Slim's medium-term plan is to create a cross-border operator that could eventually compete with the likes of Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom in Europe, and that he may also be eyeing Telecom Italia.\"We view an AMX (America Movil) approach to Telekom Austria as reinforcing the investment case for Telecom Italia and KPN,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.\"It suggests that AMX is intent on owning a small but dominant player in Europe to enjoy the future benefits of a buyout as companies build pan-European footprints.\"A PATIENT MAN?For Austria, a pact would ensure a continued say in important decisions about Telekom Austria, a former state monopoly which employs more than 9,000 people in the country, even if Slim raised his stake to overtake the OIAG's.Economy Minister Reinhold Mitterlehner, a member of the conservatives, junior partners in the ruling centrist coalition, told the Austria Press Agency he welcomed the talks with America Movil and said a final result was possible \"in the next weeks\".Austrian finance minister and conservative party leader Michael Spindelegger, whose ministry controls the OIAG, said: \"We are open for a close cooperation.\"Austria has said it wants to keep a blocking minority of at least 25 percent plus one share in Telekom Austria in the event of a widely-expected capital increase by the firm, and would not try to oppose Slim building his stake.A spokesman for Telekom Austria said the company could not comment on shareholder matters.It is unclear whether Slim would try in the first instance to bid high enough to take Telekom Austria completely private or would be content with a majority that would allow him to consolidate the company's results while leaving some shares to trade on the stock exchange.The alliance would have to offer at least the six-month share price average of 6.09 euros, well below the current price.\"If the mandatory offer is at the average price, he won't get many shares,\" said fund manager Guenther Schmitt of Raiffeisen Capital Management, who has Telekom Austria shares.\"The market is expecting Slim to do something quickly. But it could easily be that he has more patience than the market.\"With an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of 5.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Telekom Austria is expensive compared with a median of 5.2 for its European peers.It is also almost a third as expensive again as America Movil at 4.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.Telekom Austria is struggling with fierce competition in its home market, a country of 8.5 million, where mobile tariffs are among the lowest in Europe, although they have begun to rise in the past months following market consolidation last year.The company is expected to report a 12 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday.It is active in seven central and eastern European countries outside Austria, including Bulgaria, Croatia and Belarus.($1 = 0.7285 euros)(Additional reporting byMichael Shieldsin Vienna andDave Grahamin Mexico City; Editing byMark Potterand Meredith Mazzilli)"], "2014/02/25/idUS201270689420140225": ["In Italy, enter the wreckers", "2014/02/25", "By John LloydBologna \u2013As of this week, Matteo Renzi is Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third prime minister in a year. He follows Mario Monti (November 2011-April 2013) and Enrico Letta (April 2013-February 2014). At 39, Renzi is absurdly young by Italian standards, where in politics one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixties are seen as an apprenticeship period and one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventies are the time of full flowering. Renzi is full of reformist plans, as were his predecessors. He has had no national governing experience, but neither did Silvio Berlusconi when he came to the prime minister\u2019s office in 1994.The new thing about Renzi, nicknamed therottamatore\u2014 the wrecker \u2014 is how he wants to change the ways of doing politics, business and administration in Italy. Another, even newer thing, is that so do his competitors.There is no viable political force in Italy today that is politically conservative. Each of the leaders of the three major political groups says he wants to overturn the settled order. Each excoriates much of what has been the way of doing politics for much of the post-war period and proposes a leap into a new era.The most remarkable of these leaders is the never-to-be-dismissed Berlusconi. Judged guilty last summer of fraud, sentenced to a year of community work and a six-year ban from parliament, he remains leader of his party, now re-named Forza Italia. And he is still the main force on the right with 67 deputies in each of the two houses of parliament. It seems likely that he will play the card that will most embarrass Renzi: euroskepticism.Euroskepticism \u2014 a distrust in the European Union \u2014 has in the past two years soared\u00c2\u00a0in EU countries (it has always been high in the UK). In 2007, just before the financial crash, a little more than a quarter of Italians said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the EU. In aEuronews polllast summer that number grew to more than half (53 percent). For months, the newspapers of the right that support Berlusconi and Forza Italia \u2014 led byIl Giornale, owned by the Berlusconi family \u2014 have portrayed the EU as a malign institution and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a demonic force. Merkel hadreportedlyconspired with President Giorgio Napolitano to remove Berlusconi from power, so frustrated was she by his refusal to initiate reforms.Berlusconi and his party tacticians may see the coming European elections as payback time. They may think themselves fools not to take advantage of the apparent majority in Italy who have lost trust in the EU. Already, the Forza Italia representative Susy de Martini is a member of the euroskeptic group in the European parliament.Beppe Grillo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Five Star Movement follows its leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dislike of Renzi (a dislike that has been mutual). In his latest blog \u2014 the order of the day for the movement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentarians \u2014 Grillo characterizes the new government as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153born in betrayal and lies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdGrillo has already sought to fill his sails with the euroskeptic wind. Last year he called for a referendum on leaving the euro currency. His basic political position \u2014 convenient for an opposition movement and a political child of the Internet \u2014 is that anything that a mainstream politician does is an abomination. His poll ratings have slipped a little but remain above 20 percent.Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s avidity to change his party and thus change Italy has seen him cleave through the leftist leadership of the Democratic Party and engineer a party coup against Letta that forced him to resign from the premiership last week. Renzi hasshiftedthe party program toward a reformist agenda that is neither left nor right, but that views all institutions \u2014 the constitution, the electoral system, the judiciary, the labor market, regional and local governments, trade unions, schools and universities \u2014 as ripe for reform.Can he do it? Every conversation, from caf\u00c3\u00a9 counters to university seminars, asks this question; most Italians say no. Some say he is too inexperienced; working on too many fronts with an impossible coalition cabinet that includes the center-right defectors from Forza Italia. Anyway, others say, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no money, as the headline in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dailyIl Fatto Quotidianosaid.An off-the-record conversation with a parliament insider revealed worries over the quality of the untried ministers. They will, to be sure, be faced with an exhausting exercise governing in a country where industrial production has fallen by 25 percent, growth is a minimal 0.2 percent and public debt is more than 130 percent of GDP andforecastto rise.The easy pessimism of the caf\u00c3\u00a9 counter, while pardonable, is dispiriting. It is as if a country had decided to opt out of civic responsibility and merely watch the latest performing monkey in parliament do his tricks. Renzi should not have aimed his wrecking ball at Letta, who was doing a quietly efficient job with a poor hand. But he may yet inject some spirit into an anxious country. Failure would be more than an occasion for more schadenfreude. It would be a disaster. Who is left to try?PHOTO: Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi reacts during a confidence vote at the Senate in Rome February 24, 2014.\u00c2\u00a0REUTERS/Remo Casilli\u00c2"], "2014/02/25/cqn-ny-the-one-group-idUSnBw246678a+100+BSW20140225": [0, "2014/02/25", "CORRECTING and REPLACINGThe ONE Group, LLC Announces \n      Preliminary 2013 RevenueProvides Business UpdatePlease replace the release dated February 24, 2014 with the following \n      corrected version due to multiple revisions. The changes include adding \n      GAAP Revenue and Reconciliation to Total Food and Beverage Sales at \n      Owned and Managed Units in the second paragraph, and adding a table \n      after the last paragraph.The corrected release reads:THE ONE GROUP, LLC ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY 2013 REVENUEProvides Business UpdateThe ONE Group, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Committed Capital \n      Acquisition Corporation (The ONE Group) (OTCQB:STKS), today announced \n      preliminary unaudited revenue for the fourth quarter and full year ended \n      December 31, 2013.For the fourth quarter of 2013, preliminary food & beverage sales at \n      owned and managed units was approximately $33.7 million, an increase of \n      20.8% compared to approximately $27.8 million in the fourth quarter of \n      2012. Full year 2013 preliminary food and beverage sales at owned and \n      managed units was approximately $125.7 million, an increase of 17.3% as \n      compared to approximately $107.2 million in the prior year. For the \n      fourth quarter of 2013, preliminary GAAP revenue was approximately $11.4 \n      million compared to approximately $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of \n      2012. Full year 2013 preliminary GAAP revenue was approximately $46.1 \n      million as compared to approximately $60.1 million in the prior year.For the fourth quarter of 2013, comparable unit sales of our owned or \n      managed STK units improved by approximately 4.2% as compared to 2012. \n      Full year 2013 preliminary comparable unit sales of our owned or managed \n      STK units declined by approximately 0.7% as compared to 2012.Growth in food and beverage sales at our owned and managed properties in \n      2013 was primarily attributable to the ME Hotel and Hippodrome Casino \n      properties in London. This increase was partially offset by the \n      temporary closing of The Perry Hotel in 2013 for renovations.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased with our preliminary revenue performance in 2013, \n      despite some weather related issues in December, particularly in New \n      York City and the loss of revenue caused by the closing of the Perry \n      Hotel in South Beach. With the merger behind us, we have started to \n      execute on our initial objectives which included hiring a Chief \n      Operating Officer, initiating concept and design work on Rebel by STK \n      and starting to build a pipeline of attractive new locations. As \n      reported earlier this month, I am delighted to announce that this \n      initiative has kicked off with the signing of a lease for a new STK in \n      Orlando.

The DC location has been hampered by the weather which shut down \n      the DC area and caused delays in finalizing construction. Our Miami STK \n      reopening has been further delayed due to landlord development issues \n      outside of our control. We are very excited about these two locations, \n      as well as the numerous development opportunities that have come to us \n      since we announced we were becoming a public company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concluded Mr. \n      Segal.Final audited results for 2013, which will include final year-end \n      adjustments, will be reported at the end of March.About The ONE GroupThe ONE Group develops and operates upscale, high-energy restaurants and \n      lounges and provides \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ONExperience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a turn-key food and beverage \n      service for hospitality venues including boutique hotels, casinos and \n      other high-end locations in the United States and United Kingdom.

A number of \n      factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from \n      those indicated by such forward looking statements, including but not \n      limited to, (1) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the \n      business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, \n      competition, the ability of the combined company to open new restaurants \n      and food and beverage locations in current and additional markets, grow \n      and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with suppliers and \n      obtain adequate supply of products and retain its key employees; (2) \n      factors beyond our control that affect the number and timing of new \n      restaurant openings, including weather conditions and factors under the \n      control of landlords, contractors and regulatory and/or licensing \n      authorities; (3) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (4) the \n      possibility that the ONE Group may be adversely affected by other \n      economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (5) other risks and \n      uncertainties indicated from time to time in filings with the SEC by \n      Committed Capital.Investors are referred to the most recent reports filed with the SEC \n      by Committed Capital.

In this press release, we also \n      provide information with respect to Total Food and Beverage Sales at \n      Owned and Managed Properties, which represents our total revenue from \n      our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect \n      to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and \n      incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure \n      represents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies \n      total sales associated with our brands and hospitality services that we \n      provide. We believe that this measure also represents a useful internal \n      measure of performance. Accordingly, we include this non-GAAP measure so \n      that investors can review financial data that management uses in \n      evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the \n      investment community in assessing performance of restaurants and other \n      services we operate, whether or not the operation is owned by us. \n      However, because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP, \n      it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies \n      calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, this measure \n      as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled \n      measure presented by other companies. This non-GAAP measure is presented \n      as supplemental information and not as an alternative to any GAAP \n      measurements.

The private placement market, which accounts for nearly$1 trillionof investments every year, is affected by this prohibition.\u00c2\u00a0 The prohibition will also apply to \"crowdfunding\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is, sales of securities by start-up companies or small businesses to large numbers of investors over the internet. CrowdCheck's new Bad Actor Report is an invaluable tool that will help companies and financial intermediaries making these offerings avoid \"bad actors\" and protect their offerings.If an officer, director or major shareholder of a company making an offering, or anyone promoting the deal, has committed any of eight enumerated \"bad acts,\" the company may be liable for violations of the federal and state securities laws.There is no single database that a company can check for bad acts. The lack of a comprehensive, price-appropriate solution to the bad actor issue has led some issuers and their advisers to use questionnaires, asking officers and directors, in effect, to state whether they have committed any financial frauds.Brian Knight, CrowdCheck's VP for Platform Services, thinks this approach is inadequate. \"After all, liars lie,\" he points out. \"When you are screening for frauds, asking 'Are you a fraud?' isn't going to work.\"CrowdCheck's Bad Actor Report is the solution: a robust tool to screen out bad actors at a price point suitable for smaller offerings. CrowdCheck has designed a proprietary mix of databases and other sources of information that cover all eight enumerated categories of bad acts. Trained personnel then evaluate the results of the search and report back to the issuer or broker with a clear, actionable answer that meets the SEC's requirement that \"reasonable care\" be taken to avoid bad actors.The Bad Actor Report is useful for companies making securities offerings online or offline, and the law firms and broker-dealers or other intermediaries who assist them. Companies that intend to make offerings of securities in the future should also run the names of potential hires through the Bad Actor Report to avoid problems later.TheMiami-based platform EarlyShares was one of the first intermediaries to use CrowdCheck's services. In addition to obtaining CrowdCheck's complete due diligence reports for investors when EarlyShares is acting as an intermediary for a securities offering, EarlyShares also obtains Bad Actor Reports for all companies posting non-intermediated offerings with EarlyShares.Heather Lopes, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of EarlyShares says \"We have a reputation to protect, we don't want to host any offerings by Bad Actors.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0CrowdCheck has been a wonderful partner in assisting us with that effort and protecting our platform. \u00c2\u00a0We also encourage our issuers to consider higher level reports that CrowdCheck can provide to further reassure investors.\"About CrowdCheckCrowdCheck provides due diligence, disclosure and compliance services for early-stage capital-raising online. CrowdCheck's standardized, easy to read reports on companies seeking investments provide tools that investors can use to make informed investment decisions and avoid fraud. CrowdCheck can also provide customized due diligence reports for more specialized platforms. CrowdCheck's Bad Actor Report can be used by issuers, intermediaries and law firms in online and offline offerings to comply with the SEC's new Bad Actor rules. Issuers and intermediaries in crowdfunding transactions can look to CrowdCheck for assurance that an offering complies with the new rules.www.crowdcheck.com\u00c2http://badactorreport.comSOURCE  CrowdCheck"], "2014/02/25/ca-fitorbit-ranked-idUSnPnLAvlGmt+164+PRN20140225": ["FitOrbit - The Leading Enterprise Platform for Online Fitness - Rated #1 by TopTenReviews.com", "2014/02/25", "LOS ANGELES,Feb. 25, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- FitOrbit, founded by Jake \"Body by Jake\" Steinfeld, today announced that it was chosen by TopTenReviews.com \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the trusted source for online recommendations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the single best online fitness service available.FitOrbit provides employers who are committed to the wellness and productivity of their employees a unique opportunity to succeed in that mission.

From input devices like mice and keyboards to smart homes and streaming media boxes, consumers demand the convenience of wireless. With RF becoming so mainstream, designers in response expect superior RF test support from their test equipment. Even for designs without wireless technologies, engineers are facing EMI, noise, modulation and other types of frequency related signals. Now, for the same price as an MSO without spectrum analyzer capability, engineers can purchase a single instrument that meets the vast majority of their test and measurement requirements, including RF test and debug.\"There's a fundamental shift with regard to wireless in embedded systems. With RF technologies so established and affordable, they are becoming as accepted and widely used as serial data was a few years ago,\" saidDave Farrell, general manager, Mainstream Oscilloscopes at Tektronix. \"In addition, with digital signals increasing in speed, the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) has become a common problem requiring looking at the RF spectrum of even non-wireless systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Just as MSOs have replaced analog-only oscilloscopes, it follows that MDOs are the next logical evolution and are becoming the accepted mainstream industry standard.\"Under the new pricing structure, Tektronix is offering MDO4000B-3 models with a built-in 3 GHz spectrum analyzer at the same prices as current MSO4000B oscilloscopes with equivalent analog bandwidth across the entire lineup. Given identical pricing, there is no reason for designers to purchase MSO models, even if they don't have an immediate need for RF capability. Further, there is a strong likelihood they will need RF measurements at some point, saving thousands of dollars in future expense for a spectrum analyzer. With this change, Tektronix will be discontinuing** the MSO4000B oscilloscopes.\u00c2\u00a0 For customers who require 6 GHz frequency coverage, Tektronix has lowered prices on its MDO4000B-6 Series by ~15% making performance even more affordable.Underscoring the shift to mixed domain oscilloscopes, Tektronix today also expanded its range of offerings with the MDO3000 series (see separate announcement). The MDO3000 brings the ability to capture analog, digital and RF signals to a lower price point, making it an ideal entry level general purpose instrument. For more advanced debug and troubleshooting, the MDO4000B offers more scope performance and functionality such as synchronized acquisition of all signals including RF.MDO4000B Product DetailsIn addition to 4 analog and 16 digital inputs, the MDO4000B-3 oscilloscopes provide a 3 GHz maximum frequency spectrum analyzer across all MDO models from 100 MHz to 1 GHz scope bandwidth. Additionally the MDO models offer all features and options offered with the MSO4000B series.\u00c2\u00a0 For applications that require higher frequency coverage, new pricing for the Tektronix MDO4000B-6 oscilloscopes that provide a 6 GHz spectrum analyzer is now equivalent to previous pricing of the 3 GHz spectrum analyzer models.Introduced inAugust 2011, the Tektronix mixed domain oscilloscopes have gone on to win more than a dozen industry innovation awards and continue to be the only oscilloscope with an integrated spectrum analyzer that can capture time-correlated analog, digital and RF signals for a complete system view of a user's device. Engineers using MDO4000s report significant gains in debug productivity coupled with the versatility and technical capability they need to tackle a wide range of test challenges. Available analog bandwidth ranges from 100 MHz to 1 GHz with 2.5 or 5 GS/s sample rate and 20 Mpoints record length.Pricing & AvailabilityMDO4000B-3 and MDO4000B-6 oscilloscopes are available now worldwide. Pricing starts at$9,500US MSRP.** For customers with existing MSO models integrated into systems or special requirements, select MSO4000B models will remain available to support these distinct needs.Wondering what else Tektronix is up to?Check out the TektronixBandwidth Banter blogand stay up to date on the latest news from Tektronix onTwitter\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2Facebook.About TektronixFor more than sixty-five years, engineers have turned toTektronixfor test, measurement and monitoring solutions to solve design challenges, improve productivity and dramatically reduce time to market.

Zionism means nationalism and is totally contradictory to the above. Judaism teaches that we are in exile by Divine decree and are forbidden to create our own sovereignty.\u00c2\u00a0 We must be humble toward all nations and not make any attempts to leave exile, until the day when the Almighty alone will redeem us, without any human intervention, as He promised. The Torah forbids us to kill, steal or harm others in any manner.Therefore, on all accounts, Zionism is contradictory to Judaism.Authentic religious Jewish leaders have always opposed the existence of theState of Israel. As Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinky, Chief Rabbi of Palestine, stated in a declaration to the United Nations in 1947: \"We furthermore wish to express our definite opposition to a Jewish state in any part of Palestine\". (The Rabbis Speak Out, The 130-year Record of Religious Jewish Opposition to Zionism, p. 81)This new Zionist demand in effect forces the Palestinians to forfeit their right of return to their ancestral land. And likewise they are once again attempting to steal the Jewish identity from the true Jewish people: the people who keep the Almighty's laws.One of their worst atrocities has been their false appropriation of Jewish identity, symbolized by their use of the name \"Israel\" - the Biblical name of the Jewish people. By acting in our name, they implicate us in their offenses and drag us into their conflicts.We ask the world to recognize that the Zionist state is not a Jewish state, has no connection with the Jewish people and has no right to use the name \"Israel\".May we live to see true peace under a Palestinian state, in which Jews and Palestinians will live side by side in harmony as they did in centuries past.www.nkusa.orgSOURCE  Neturei Karta International"], "2014/02/25/hydro-germany-automotive-idUSWEB00J2N20140225": ["Norsk Hydro to build new German aluminium production line", "2014/02/25", "OSLOFeb 25 (Reuters) - Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk\nHydro will spend 130 million euros to build a new\nproduction line at its rolled products plant in Grevenbroich in\nGermany to meet increased demand for automotive parts.The new line, which will produce car body sheet for hoods,\ndoors, and side panels, will be completed in the second half of\n2016, and the cost of the investment will be distributed through\n2014-2016, Hydro said.The new plant is part of the firm's recent decision to\ndecision to expand the annual continuous heat treatment capacity\nfrom 20,000 to 50,000 metric tonnes.(Reporting byBalazs Koranyi)"], "2014/02/25/md-federalrealty-citi-idUSnPnPHvDPD1+16e+PRN20140225": [0, "2014/02/25", "ROCKVILLE, Md.,Feb. 25, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2Federal Realty Investment Trust(NYSE:FRT) today announced that it will be participating in the 2014 Citi Global Property CEO Conference, held onMarch 2ndto 5thinHollywood, Florida.Donald C.

A3CUBE'sIn-Memory Networktechnology, for the first time, allows direct shared non-coherent global memory across the entire network, enabling global communication based on shared memory segments and direct load/store operations between the nodes. The result is the lowest possible latency, massive scalability and disruptive performance that is orders of magnitude beyond the capabilities of today's network technologies including, Ethernet, InfiniBand and Fibre Channel.\"Organizations struggle to keep up with the amount of traffic on traditional networks generated from a variety of sources,\" saidBob Laliberte, senior analyst, ESG. \"A3CUBE'sIn-memory Networkfabric leverages an innovative approach to transforming HPC, Big Data and data center environments in order to drive greater performance and efficiencies in the network and storage systems. A3CUBE is extending PCIe capabilities in order to deliver a next generation network that it claims will overcome traditional network bottlenecks utilizing a high performance (Nano-second latency) and massively scalable architecture.\"The innovative RONNIEE Express data plane enables exascale storage that combines supercomputing's massively parallel operational concepts and an innovative I/O interface eliminating central switching, thanks to the support of a multi-dimensional topology like 2D/3D Torus and Hypercubes. This reduces network overhead, slashing the latency of traditional storage networking designs and introduces military grade reliability along with carrier grade data plane features. The unique RONNIEE Express communication mechanism creates a genuine paradigm shift in network communication that introduces a full application with a transparent memory-to-memory direct connection. The In-Memory Networkdiscards the protocol stack bottleneck and replaces it with a direct memory-to-memory mapped socket, producing extraordinary and disruptive performance enhancements while leveraging commodity hardware.\"Today's data center architectures were never designed to handle the extreme I/O and data access demands of HPC, Hadoop and other Big Data applications,\" saidEmilio Billi, founder and CTO of A3CUBE.\u00c2\u00a0 \"The scalability and performance limitations inherent in current network designs are too severe to be rescued by incremental enhancements. The only way to accommodate the next generation of high performance data applications is with a radical new design that delivers disruptive performance gains to eradicate the network bottlenecks and unlock true application potential.\"A3CUBE's first three products incorporating the RONNIEE Express product line address different data center requirements in building out anIn-Memory Networkfabric and include:RONNIEE 2SRONNIEE 2S is a compact PCIe-based intelligent NIC designed to maximize application performance using a unique combination of hardware and software.

Some Republicans criticized provisions of the bill, including expanded health coverage for veterans who do not suffer from any war-related injuries.Republicans also were trying to attach a controversial provision unrelated to veterans programs: possible new sanctions on Iran, which the Obama administration opposes as a potential threat to diplomatic efforts that are aimed at stopping that country's suspected nuclear weapons program.Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said the Department of Veterans Affairs is unable to effectively run existing programs. \"We're putting a bill to expand the responsibilities instead of holding them accountable to the responsibilities they have today,\" Coburn complained.The Sanders bill, with a $24 billion price tag, comes after Congress recently repealed a pension benefit cut for veterans that Congress and President Barack Obama had signed off on as part of a broader bipartisan budget deal crafted in January.The Senate debate also was unfolding as Obama prepares to unveil his 2015 budget blueprint, which will call for military spending cuts in the post-Iraq and Afghanistan war era and refocusing spending more on domestic programs.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said that with war spending diminishing, \"It is only fair that we use a small portion of those savings to invest in our returning veterans.\"Republicans, however, have long objected to Democrats' attempts to take war fund accounts and apply them to new domestic spending. Instead, Republicans have argued that savings from the draw-down of combat operations should help reduce budget deficits.Besides healthcare improvements, the legislation would expand access to educational benefits for veterans and their survivors.Veterans returning from the two wars, many of whom suffer from combat-related psychological problems or severe wounds from roadside explosive devices, have often had to deal with long waits before receiving care at federally run medical facilities.Sanders' bill attempts to reduce those backlogs.There are an estimated 2.6 million veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, according to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.(Editing byChizu Nomiyama)"], "2014/02/25/tx-intervale-capital-idUSnPnLAvlfcx+160+PRN20140225": ["Intervale Capital Raises $495 Million Fund in First and Final Close Bringing Cumulative Funds Raised to $1.2 Billion", "2014/02/25", "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.,Feb. 25, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0Intervale Capital (\"Intervale\"), an energy-focused private equity firm with offices inCambridge, MassachusettsandHouston, Texas, today announced the closing of Intervale Capital Fund III, L.P.

The awards will not be a clean sweep for any particular picture, although the other award winners are expected to beJared Letofor best supporting actor inDallas Buyers Club;Cate Blanchet for best actress inBlue Jasmine; andLupita Nyong'o for best supporting actress in12 Years a Slave.Last year, Farsite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlargely alone among prognosticators\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcorrectly predictedChristoph Waltzwould win best supporting actor forDjango Unchained. According to some, Farsite also went out on a limb with its pick ofArgofor best picture, but they were correct again, despite the age-old rule that the best picture Oscar typically goes to the best director. WhileArgodirectorBen Affleckwas not nominated for best director, in what many considered a snub, his movie did win.Farsite uses a first-of-its kind data-modeling tool to predict Oscar winners. The model analyzes more than 40 years of film industry and Academy Award related information to forecast probabilities for the winners. This information includes real-time data and an array of variables, including total nominations, other Guild nominations and wins, buzz and nominees' previous winning performances.According to Farsite data scientists, there are three factors to the model for predicting Oscar winners: current awards, buzz and prior performance. The first factor to consider is that during awards season there are other award winners that can provide insight into likely Oscar winners.\u00c2\u00a0 The second factor to consider is the momentum or buzz behind particular nominees.\u00c2\u00a0 Since Oscars are at the end of awards season, if the results of previous awards and other buzz by theglitteratiare strong enough to sway the votes of some members of the Academy, then signals that historically point to the \"correct\" nominee could be hijacked.\u00c2\u00a0 The third factor is the history or prior performance of the nominees.\u00c2\u00a0 Some nominees may have an edge given their past.About ICCICC (Information Control Company), based inColumbus, Ohio, is a leading provider of enterprise technology solutions.

Russia!\", protesters in Crimea have become the last major bastion of resistance to Ukraine's new rulers.President Viktor Yanukovich's overthrow on Saturday has been accepted across the vast country, even in his power base in the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine.But Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula attached to the rest of Ukraine by just a narrow strip of land, is alone so far in challenging the new order.As the only Ukrainian region with an ethnic Russian majority, and a home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, the strategically important territory is also now the focus of a battle between Russia and the West over the future of Ukraine.Tensions are mounting in the regional capital Simferopol as separatists try to exploit the chaos after the changes in Kiev to press demands for Russia to reclaim the territory which Communist leader Nikita Khrushchev gifted in 1954 to the Soviet Ukraine.Washington has warned Moscow not to send in tanks, an action that could result in yet another war in a region that has been fought over - and changed hands - many times in history.But President Vladimir Putin flexed his muscles on Wednesday, putting military forces in western Russia on alert and saying Russia was acting to ensure the security of its facilities in the Crimean port of Sevastopol.The view from separatists in Crimea is that there has never been a better time to appeal to Moscow for help than now.\"I crossed two oceans and four seas with the Russian navy, and now I have fascists telling me what to do?\" said Daniyel Romanenko, a 73-year-old retired officer, portraying the new Ukrainian leadership in the worst possible terms in a country that was overrun by Nazi Germany in World War Two.\"We should be given the choice to unite at last with Russia,\" he said at a rally in Sevastopol, wearing his uniform.MOB RULECrimea's balmy climate once made it a favored holiday destination for Russian tsars and Soviet leaders. Its vineyards, orchards and the \"green riviera\" along its southern coast make for some stunning scenery.But even before the national parliament in Kiev stripped Yanukovich of his powers on Saturday, after three months of protests by largely pro-Europe demonstrators, there were rallies in Crimea by worried ethnic Russians.Although he was little loved in Moscow, Russia had backed Yanukovich and his departure reduces the Kremlin's ability to influence Ukraine.For the more than 1 million ethnic Russians in Crimea, it increases uncertainty, and many want protection by Mother Russia, with whom cultural and religious ties are strong.Some are especially enraged that the new leaders have rolled back laws to strengthen the importance of using the Ukrainian language, which is not the mother tongue for many in Crimea, and refuse to recognize them as Ukraine's leaders.\"We don't have a legitimate government so we have to look out for ourselves,\" said Vladimir, a 37-year-old businessman.Taking matters into their own hands, separatist-minded protesters at a rally on Sunday voted to appoint Alexei Chaly, a Russian businessman, as the de facto mayor of Sevastopol in a show of hands.The next day the presence of a large crowd on the streets outside a meeting of the city administration ensured his appointment could not be blocked.The chaotic events, followed by more protests on Tuesday and Wednesday, and more calls for secession, underline how difficult the transition of power may be in Ukraine, especially in Crimea.\"BANANA REPUBLIC\"Rumors that protesters from Kiev's barricades might be on their way from the capital to put down separatist moves have prompted some Crimeans to create informal self-defense units.Around 3,000 men have signed up in Sevastopol alone, with military veterans and former members of the Berkut riot police training the younger recruits, the organizers say.In other parts of Ukraine, particularly Kiev, the Berkut is despised as the force which fired on protesters.\"We need to protect ourselves from the armed criminals coming to Crimea in masks to cause unrest. They've turned Ukraine into a banana republic,\" said Gennady Basov, the leader of the Russian Bloc party that represents ethnic Russians.Unification with Russia is not the party's main aim, but it believes that splitting Ukraine down the middle - between Russian-speaking areas in the east and regions where Ukrainian is predominant in the west - makes economic and cultural sense.\"Most of the economic strength of Ukraine is in the east - that's where people actually work. In the west they just go to Kiev to protest,\" Basov said, underlining ethnic Russians' contempt for the protesters in Kiev, many of whom are from the west of the country.Such remarks show how the protests in Kiev, triggered by Yanukovich's decision in November to spurn trade and political deals with the European Union and rebuild ties with former Soviet overlord Moscow, have widened divisions in Ukraine.For some ethnic Russians in Crimea, it was the last straw. Already connected to southern Ukraine by land that is only five km (three miles) wide at some points, the region seems to them to have less in common with the rest of the country than ever.\"The people don't understand this was a revolution against a criminal government, they think it's all Western influence. To them the people on the barricades are now greater enemies than the corrupt government they overthrew,\" said Leonid Pylunskyy, a regional deputy for the conservative Kurultai Rukh party.Pylunskyy is the fourth generation of his family to call Crimea home, but both his children participated in the Kiev protests - his son on the barricades, his daughter providing demonstrators with hot tea and sandwiches.RUMOURS, RUMOURSBarely an hour goes by without a new rumor of troops massing or protesters on their way from Kiev to \"restore order\".Putin himself stirred the pot by suddenly announcing a drill that involved putting forces in the west and centre of Russia on the alert. He may be sabre-rattling but is unpredictable and brooding after apparently losing a geopolitical tussle with the West over Ukraine which brought back memories of the Cold War.Many Russians regard Ukraine as little more than a Russian vassal. Opinion polls suggest a majority of Russians still view Crimea, annexed by Russia in 1783, as a Russian territory.But not all the peninsula's residents are pro-Russia or against the new political situation, as was witnessed by confrontations between rival protesters outside the regional parliament in Simferopol on Wednesday.The region is a patchwork of different ethnic groups and theTatars, now back in numbers after their ancestors were deported to Central Asia or Russia's Urals region by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, dread the idea of integration with Russian.\"In 1783 we fell under the power of the Russian empire and that's when all our sorrows began. The (Crimean ethnic) Russians can look to Putin. We're sticking with Ukraine,\" Crimean Tatar leader Refat Chubarov said in an interview.Chubarov outlined what he saw as deliberate moves by the ethnic Russians to fuel tension. \"This is their plan: they've stoked the fires in Sevastopol, now they want to light the fires in Simferopol, so all Crimea burns,\" he said.Civil war or a serious threat to ethnic Russians in Crimea might, the logic goes, might bring in the Russian cavalry.\"I hope I'm wrong but Russia could well decide to deploy its forces in Crimea,\" Chubarov said.BATTLE LINES DRAWNRival groups of ethnic Tatars and ethnic Russians confronted each other outside the regional parliament on Wednesday but eventually dispersed after scuffles.Conflict is hardly unusual for the people of Crimea.It was inhabited or invaded by Scythians, Greeks, Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Kazhars, Kipchaks, Turks and Mongols, and was part of the Roman and Byzantine empires before it became part of the Russian empire.There were fierce battles on Crimea during World War Two, when it was occupied by the Nazis, and during the Crimean War which Russia lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman empire and Sardinia.\"We're used to being fought over. We've had the Turks, British, Germans and now this,\" said Igor, a 26-year-old businessman from Simferopol.(Writing by Alessandra Prentice andTimothy Heritage; Editing byRichard BalmforthandGiles Elgood)"], "2014/02/26/idUSnCCN2G1lRR+1d3+MKW20140226": [0, "2014/02/26", "Saint Jean Carbon Announces Close of $400,000 Flow Through Private PlacementOAKVILLE, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 26, 2014) -NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATESSaint Jean Carbon Inc.

The Walker property consists of 4 claims covering the past mine and 11 claims covering interesting geological context for more graphite mineralization in the region around the deposit, which is located 40 km north-east of Ottawa. The Mount Copeland molybdenum deposit lies within metamorphic rocks flanking the southern margin of Frenchman Cap Dome, 32 kilometers northwest of Revelstoke, British Columbia (the \"Mount Copeland Property\"). The Fort-Eden copper property is comprised of 18 mineral tenures that total 2,828.6 hectares in area. The mineral claims are located 100 km west of Fort St. James, BC (the \"Fort Eden Property\"). The Red Bird deposit is comprised of three zones of molybdenum concentration referred to as the Main, Southeast and Southwest zones within a property totaling 1,836 ha (4,400 acres) and is located 133 km southwest of Burns Lake and 105 km north of Bella Coola (the \"Red Bird Property\"). The Company plans to divest (the \"Divestitures\") each of the Mount Copeland Property, the Fort Eden Property and the Red Bird Property through a sale or joint venture, thus allowing it to focus on building a graphite mining company. Additionally, Saint Jean expects to acquire a further new lump graphite properties in Quebec (the \"Clot, Acquisition\") and the previously announced new lump graphite properties in Sri Lanka from Han Tal Graphite (Pvt) Ltd.

Initially, Solazyme is focused on \n      commercializing its products into three target markets: (1) fuels and \n      chemicals, (2) nutrition and (3) skin and personal care.Solazyme\u00c2\u00ae, Algenist\u00c2\u00ae, \n      Tailored\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, Renewable\u00e2\u201e\u00a2and the Solazyme logo are trademarks of \n      Solazyme, Inc.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes the following financial measure defined as a \n      \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-GAAP financial measure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Securities and Exchange Commission: \n      non-GAAP net loss. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial \n      measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial \n      information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of \n      accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in \n      isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and \n      presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n      For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest \n      comparable GAAP measure, see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP \n      Net-Loss Per Share\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd included in the tables to this press release.This non-GAAP measure is provided to enhance investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overall \n      understanding of Solazyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current financial performance and Solazyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      prospects for the future. Specifically, Solazyme believes the non-GAAP \n      measure provides useful information to both management and investors by \n      excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of its core \n      operating results and business outlook.For its internal budgeting process, Solazyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management uses financial \n      measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense or special \n      expenses such as non-cash gains or losses due to warrant revaluations. \n      In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, Solazyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management \n      also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measure in reviewing the financial \n      results of Solazyme. Solazyme excludes stock-based compensation expenses \n      and special non-cash charges from its non-GAAP measures primarily \n      because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are \n      reflective of ongoing operating results.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within \n      the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \n      about Solazyme, including statements that involve risks and \n      uncertainties concerning: its commercialization and production plans and \n      commercialization timetable for its products; the growth of product and \n      research and development revenues; selling prices for products; the \n      ramping up of facilities; the timetable for bringing facilities online; \n      meeting commercialization and technology targets; and Solazyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability \n      to maintain its relationships with its partners.

According to a survey by Ipsos Open Thinking Exchange (OTX) from December 2013, 84% of Americans ages 18-64 state that online reviews help in their decision whether or not to purchase a product. This development indicates a clear trend toward using the Internet as a trusted source for reviews written by consumers who share their experience online. While positive reviews can be very beneficial to a business, negative reviews can be detrimental. And with the sheer volume of websites, ranging from yelp.com for restaurant recommendations to zocdoc.com where patients rate their doctors, it is extremely time consuming, if not impossible, for business owners to keep track of all reviews.The increased use of mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets means that more consumers are searching and finding local businesses online. Meanwhile, the growing trust in online reviews leads to users making decisions based on fewer reviews, so every review counts, resulting in the emergence ofonline monitoringcompanies such as FreeReviewMonitoring.com that are designed to help businesses keep track of their online reputation. New web designs with clear and easy review or star-rating systems are becoming more important to consumers and can be extremely valuable to local business owners. Michael Luca, a professor at Harvard Business School, took a closer look at the impact Yelp has on local businesses. For his study he combined Yelp reviews with revenues and found that a one-star increase on Yelp leads to a 5 to 9% increase in revenue.The advantages ofonline reviewsfor businesses are undeniable, and it is now vital for owners to monitor their feedback on all relevant websites. This has become a real issue for small and medium-sized businesses, who cannot afford to pay up to 400 dollars per year for monitoring services. But now a free service, FreeReviewMonitoring.com, comes to the rescue. After signing up subscribers get daily alerts and suggestions on how to deal with bad reviews. Reacting to negative feedback in a timely manner can make all the difference: according to the National Association for Retail Marketing Services, 95% of unhappy customers will return if an issue is resolved quickly and efficiently. FreeReviewMonitoring.com will make sure you know when it is time to act.Signing up is easy: enter your business' name, address and website, and lean back.

This was the fourth consecutive quarter of \n      year-over-year revenue decline, as server market demand remained weak \n      ahead of a forthcoming refresh cycle, which is expected to emerge in \n      early 2014. Worldwide server shipments increased 8.2% to 2.5 million \n      units in 4Q13 when compared with the same year-ago period. For the full \n      year 2013, worldwide server revenue decreased -4.4% to $49.7 billion \n      when compared to 2012, while worldwide unit shipments increased 3.2% to \n      9.0 million units, a record high.On a year-over-year basis, volume systems experienced 8.0% revenue \n      growth to $10.2 billion in 4Q13. At the same time, demand for midrange \n      and high-end systems experienced sharp year-over-year revenue declines \n      of -19.6% and -28.5% to $1.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, in \n      4Q13. The volume segment was aided by a continued expansion of x86-based \n      hyperscale server infrastructures.\"While a record number of servers shipped in 4Q13, the market was \n      constrained by weak demand for midrange and high-end systems. The market \n      continues to be impacted by enterprise focus on 2nd platform workload \n      consolidation, which at this point in time is only partially offset by \n      3rd Platform hyperscale server deployments around the globe,\" saidMatt \n      Eastwood, Group Vice President and General Manager, Enterprise \n      Platforms at IDC. \"2nd Platform workloads continue to represent a \n      healthy profit pool for server vendors targeting consolidation \n      opportunities across the market. However, new profit pools in the 3rd \n      Platform are emerging that create new market opportunities for OEMs and \n      ODMs. IDC believes this market transformation requires increased focus \n      from vendors in order to best capitalize on these diverging market \n      trends.\"Overall Server Market Standings, by VendorHP and IBM were statistically tied* for the number 1 position in the \n      worldwide server systems market. HP had 26.9% market share in factory \n      revenue for 4Q13, as revenue increased 5.7% year over year to $3.8 \n      billion. HP experienced improvements in demand for its x86-based \n      ProLiant servers, particularly in the U.S. IBM had 26.8% market share \n      for the quarter as revenue decreased -28.5% year over year to $3.8 \n      billion in 4Q13. IBM experienced significant year-over-year declines in \n      quarterly revenue for all three families of systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c System x, POWER \n      Systems, and System z mainframes. Dell server revenue declined -2.4% \n      year over year to $2.1 billion, maintaining third place with 14.5% \n      factory revenue market share in 4Q13.

Linux servers now represent 28.5% \n        of all server revenue, up 4.6 points when compared with the fourth \n        quarter of 2012.Microsoft Windows server hardware revenue increased 0.1% year over \n        year in 4Q13 with quarterly server hardware revenue totaling $6.5 \n        billion, representing 45.7% of overall quarterly factory revenue, up \n        2.0 points over the prior year's quarter.Unix servers experienced a revenue decline of -20.2% year over year to \n        $1.9 billion representing 13.6% of quarterly server revenue for the \n        quarter.After four consecutive quarters of revenue growth, IBM's System z \n        mainframe running z/OS revenue declined -36.8% year over year to $1.1 \n        billion, representing 8.0% of all server revenue in 4Q13.\"The Unix market continued its secular decline, and mainframes had large \n      declines on a difficult compare to a year ago, amid explosive growth in \n      hyperscale and ODM Direct sales,\" saidKuba \n      Stolarski, Research Manager, Servers at IDC. \"As the Unix server \n      market continues to undergo consolidation and price compression, and as \n      mainframes find their niche, IDC believes that the server market is very \n      close to a tipping point, when hyperscale growth will be large enough to \n      overshadow declines in the high-end. The additional growth in ODM Direct \n      sales, spurred most recently by massive datacenter expansion by some of \n      the largest service providers, will help the server market reach that \n      tipping point faster.\"x86 Industry Standard Server Market DynamicsDemand for x86 servers continued to improve in 4Q13, with revenues \n      growing 7.8% in the quarter to $10.7 billion worldwide with unit \n      shipments up 8.6% year over year to 2.5 million servers. HP led the \n      market with 32.2% revenue share based on 8.9% revenue growth while \n      gaining 0.3 points of share when compared to 4Q12. Dell retained second \n      place, securing 19.2% revenue share following a -2.4% year-over-year \n      revenue decline while losing 2.0 points of share when compared with the \n      fourth quarter of 2012. IBM rounded out the top three x86 server \n      positions, holding 12.7% revenue share following a-15.9% year-over-year factory revenue decline.Modular Form Factor ResultsThere are two types of modular form factors, each with a distinct use \n      case. Blade servers, which are highly leveraged in enterprise \n      consolidation and virtualization, grew 2.8% year over year to $2.4 \n      billion. Blades now account for 17.0% of total server revenue. HP \n      maintained the number 1 position in the blade server market in 4Q13 with \n      44.0% revenue share; Cisco and IBM held the second and third positions \n      in the blade market with 20.5% and 19.5% revenue share, respectively.Density optimized servers, utilized by large homogeneous hyperscale \n      datacenters, also experienced solid demand in 4Q13. Revenue grew 70.3% \n      year over year in 4Q13 to $1.2 billion as unit shipments increased 64.6% \n      to just over 382,000 servers. Density optimized servers now represent \n      8.5% of all server revenue and 15.4% of all server shipments. HP \n      maintained the number 1 position in the density optimized segment and \n      Dell held the number 2 position in 4Q13 with 34.9% and 19.7% revenue \n      share, respectively.\"Blades and density optimized servers account for a quarter of server \n      market revenue, up from one fifth a year ago,\" said Stolarski. \"That is \n      further evidence that the shift towards public cloud hyperscale \n      deployments on one hand, and private clouds on integrated systems on the \n      other, is real and significant. Since a large portion of hyperscale is \n      still deployed on rack-mounted servers, the potential for modular design \n      growth in the near future is substantial.\"IDC's Server TaxonomyIDC's Server Taxonomy maps the eleven price bands within the server \n      market into three price ranges: volume servers, midrange servers and \n      high-end servers. The revenue data presented in this release is stated \n      as factory revenue for a server system. IDC presents data in factory \n      revenue to determine market share position. Factory revenue represents \n      those dollars recognized by multi-user system and server vendors for ISS \n      and upgrade units sold through direct and indirect channels and includes \n      the following embedded server components: Frame or cabinet and all \n      cables, processors, memory, communications boards, operating system \n      software, other bundled software and initial internal and external disk \n      shipments.IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Server Tracker is a quantitative tool for \n      analyzing the global server market on a quarterly basis. The Tracker \n      includes quarterly shipments (both ISS and upgrades) and revenues (both \n      customer and factory), segmented by vendor, family, model, region, \n      operating system, price band, CPU type, and architecture.

Yomtov countered that there was no such legal requirement, and Jacobson concurred.\"It makes no sense for this court to allow for the passing of three or four months for sentencing,\" Jacobson said.Mack declined to comment after the hearing.State law dictates that convicted New Jersey officials cannot hold public office. Mack has refused to step down, so state prosecutors filed a motion recently seeking to have him removed from office.Prosecutors said that under the kickback scheme, the developers - who were in fact government informants - would buy city property for the garage for $100,000 less than the value of the land, and the Democratic mayor of New Jersey's capital city would receive money in exchange, prosecutors said.Mack's brother, Ralphiel Mack, was convicted of extortion and bribery after prosecutors said he acted as a bag man to pick up bribe money. Informants offered $119,000, about $54,000 of which changed hands, prosecutors said.The ousted mayor faces a maximum sentence of 110 years behind bars at sentencing on May 14 by Judge Michael Shipp, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.Mack has been accused by critics of nepotism and mismanagement since taking office in 2010 in the crime-plagued, economically depressed city of 85,000 people. He was reportedly deeply in debt at the time of his arrest in 2012.Acting mayor Muschal's appointment is retroactive to Mack's conviction, which gives him the authority to reverse decisions that Mack has made since his conviction.(Additional reporting by Hilary Russ; Writing byChris Francescani; Editing by Gunna Dickson)"], "2014/02/26/idUSnMKWp6bwsa+1c0+MKW20140226": ["oti Granted New U.S. Patent for Multi-Application Contactless Smart Card", "2014/02/26", "oti Granted New U.S. Patent for Multi-Application Contactless Smart CardROSH PINA, ISRAEL--(Marketwired - Feb 26, 2014) -On Track Innovations Ltd.(NASDAQ:OTIV), a global provider of near field communication (NFC) and cashless payment solutions under the brand \"oti,\" has been issued a new patent by the\u00c2\u00a0United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that enhances its innovations in the field of contactless smart cards.The new U.S. patentNo. 8,651,387, titled \"Multi-Application Contactless Smart Card,\" describes a multi-application contactless smart card system and method that allows a user to select an application using a unique switching mechanism located on board the smart card. This innovation allows, for example, the accommodation of several 'application cards' on the same physical card.Generally, smart cards support a single application, such as a particular credit card. However, today's consumers typically carry a variety of credit cards, including a combination of debit and credit cards, fuel cards, high-security identification and access-control cards, public transport payment cards, and drivers licenses. Carrying around these numerous cards can be cumbersome. However, oti's newly patented technology solves this problem by allowing contactless smart cards to support multiple uses.According to BCC Research, smart card shipments are expected to reach 11.1 billion units or $7.3 billion in total sales by 2017. Smart card technology is a major driving force for the payment transaction market, since it allows customers to make secure payments. The rapid growth of contactless smart cards is being driven by a multitude of factors, including mobile device proliferation, new NFC standards, faster processing speeds, increased security concerns, and consumer demand for greater convenience.The newly issued patent strengthens oti's growing presence in the contactless payment market, where oti's payment solutions have been certified by MasterCard, Visa, and others.\"Over the last 20 years, oti has continuously invested in innovation,\" noted Dimitrios Angelis, the company's chairman and CEO of oti America. \"Through the patent system, we continue to create and protect the value of technology that has been developed by our world-class engineers. This patent supports our ongoing efforts to monetize our intellectual property through business operations, licensing and related arrangements.\"About otiOn Track Innovations Ltd.

Operations were suspended for the Christmas holidays and resumed in early January on a 24-hour continuous basis with two 12-hour shifts daily. Thirty-five (35) drill holes have been completed to date, for a total of 4,126 metres. A contract has been signed for a second drill rig which is expected to arrive on site in May, with the aim of completing the 26,600 meter, 135 hole program by late summer, with two drills operating on a 24-hour basis.The holes drilled to date in the current program are short holes at the northern base of the Montagne d'Or deposit, designed to test the near surface projection of the secondary Lower Favorable Zone (\"LFZ\") and Footwall Zone (\"FWZ\"). Some of the holes were collared into the principal Upper Felsic Zone (\"UFZ\") to reach the LFZ. Gold assay results have been received for the first 12 holes. All holes intersected sulphide-gold mineralised intervals; notable intersections include:Hole MO-13-10730.0 to 36.0 m6.06 g/t gold over 6.0 m (4.6 m True Width (\"TW\"))70.0 to 87.7 m2.27 g/t gold over 17.7 m (14.2 m TW)Hole MO-13-1081.0 to 28.0 m1.26 g/t gold over 27.0 m (20.3 m TW)Hole MO-14-1105.0 to 9.0 m6.57 g/t gold over 4.0 m (3.1 m TW)Hole MO-14-115107.2 to 116.0 m3.50 g/t gold over 8.8 m (6.7 m TW)Hole MO-14-11667.1 to 70.0 m11.67 g/t gold over 2.9 m (2.3 m TW)A drill plan and full assay results are available at the following links:www.columbusgoldcorp.com/i/nr/2014-02-26-drillplan.pdfwww.columbusgoldcorp.com/i/nr/2014-02-26-assays.pdfThe drilling is being funded by Nord Gold N.V. as part of a 3 year minimum US$30 million exploration and development program pursuant to which Nord Gold can earn a 50.01% interest in Montagne d'Or and certain Paul Isnard mineral claims, by completing a bankable feasibility study.The Montagne d'Or deposit contains a NI 43-101 compliant inferred gold resource using a cut-off grade of 0.3 grams per tonne gold of 5.37 million ounces within 117.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.43 grams per tonne gold. Using a cut-off of 1 gram per tonne gold a resource of 4.15 million ounces within 58.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.22 grams per tonne gold. The resources are defined within a gold mineralized area of 2,250 meters by 400 meters and to an average depth of 250 meters from surface. The mineralized zones remain open in part along strike and at depth.The objectives of the Phase II drilling program are to:Complete a 50-meter spacing array to a vertical depth of 200 meters from surface, and select 25-meter in-fill, focused on mineralisation potentially amenable to open pit mining;internally increase the current mineral resource;increase confidence in the gold grade-width distribution;convert inferred resources to the indicated category in accordance with NI 43-101 standards;acquire a better distribution of copper assays for added value to the deposit.Qualified Person, Technical Info and QA/QCDiamond drill holes were bored with HQ-size core in the upper oxidized saprolitic zone and NQ-size core in fresh rock. The core was placed in plastic core boxes with covers and delivered by the drilling contractor, Performax Drilling Inc., a Canadian company with qualified personnel, to the Citron camp logging facilities, located 5 km from Montagne d'Or. Columbus Gold personnel are present at the camp at all times during the drilling program.The core was photographed for reference, logged (geotechnical and geological) and identified sulphide mineralised sections were sawed in half. Sample lengths vary between 0.5 to 1.5 metres. Individual half core samples were placed in canvas bags and sealed by batch of 9 samples in polypropylene bags for air transport to the Cayenne and trucking to Filab Amsud laboratory in Paramaribo, Suriname, an ISO 9001 and ISO / IEC 17025 accredited laboratory. The remaining half core is stored in core racks on site at Citron camp for reference. Samples were assayed for gold by fire-assay method using an atomic absorption finish on a 50-gram pulp split.A quality assurance and quality control program (QA/QC) was implemented by Columbus Gold and Filab Amsud to insure the accuracy and reproducibility of the analytical method and results are maintained. The QA/QC program includes the insertion of standards, blanks and field duplicates in each laboratory assay batch and systematic re-assaying of samples returning values above 5 g/t Au by the fire-assay method using a gravimetric finish on a 50-gram pulp split. As well, 10% of random sample pulps are sent to SGS del Peru S.A.C. laboratory for gold check assaying.The drilling program is being conducted under the supervision of Rock Lefran\u00c3\u00a7ois, P.Geo.

Income from operations \n      in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased to $58.9 million from $36.2 \n      million in the same period of 2012.Fourth-quarter 2013 net income was $26.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted \n      share, compared with $61.9 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in the \n      fourth quarter of 2012, which included a $52.4 million tax benefit, \n      partially offset by approximately $7.5 million (net of tax) in \n      acquisition-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA (see description below) in \n      the fourth quarter of 2013 increased to $129.3 million compared with \n      $83.6 million in the same period of 2012.Comments on the Fourth Quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our fourth-quarter results were below expectations, as an unanticipated \n      slowdown due to adverse weather and the timing of holidays in December \n      affected our business after a very strong start in October,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Alan \n      S. McKim, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our Industrial and \n      Field Services segment, this caused our lodging occupancy to be down \n      more than 10% in the quarter. Our Technical Services segment did not see \n      its typical seasonal uptick in the final weeks of the year. While \n      incineration utilization was 91%, the mix was less favorable toward \n      year-end. Within Safety-Kleen, our Oil Re-refining and Recycling segment \n      experienced a drop-off in shipments late in the year as buyers slowed \n      purchases to reduce inventory. In our Oil and Gas Field Services \n      segment, this business did not generate its expected fourth-quarter ramp \n      in activity due to cancelled programs. The combination of these factors \n      resulted in a significant shortfall in our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdFull-Year 2013 ResultsRevenues for 2013 increased 60% to $3.51 billion from $2.19 billion in \n      2012. Income from operations in 2013 was $220.6 million compared with \n      $202.2 million in 2012. Net income for 2013 was $95.6 million, or $1.57 \n      per diluted share, compared with $129.7 million, or $2.40 per diluted \n      share, in 2012. 2013 net income included $17.5 million in pre-tax \n      integration and severance costs, and $13.6 million in pre-tax \n      adjustments related to acquisition accounting. 2012 net income included \n      the $52.4 million tax benefit, a $26.4 million pre-tax charge related to \n      refinancing and the $7.5 million (net of tax) in acquisition-related \n      costs. Adjusted EBITDA (see description below) increased 36% in 2013 to \n      $510.1 million from $373.8 million for 2012.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we did not hit the financial targets we established for 2013 due \n      to challenging market conditions, it still was a year of significant \n      achievement for the Company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McKim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Company's safety record \n      continued to improve and we exceeded our goals for the year. OurSafety \n      Starts with Me: Live It 3-6-5initiative is paying dividends and \n      customers are awarding us new work because of our continuous improvement \n      program. Through the hard work of our team, we successfully integrated \n      Safety-Kleen and are now positioned for growth on a common operating \n      platform. During the year, we invested in a number of organic growth \n      opportunities including the construction of our Ruth Lake Lodge, which \n      in addition to being a first-class lodging facility, is serving as a \n      training facility for our employees and a maintenance hub for our \n      vehicles in the Ft. McMurray, Alberta Canada market. We also acquired \n      Evergreen Oil in September, which expanded our presence into the \n      California market and will serve as a strong complement to our existing \n      network going forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We enter 2014 with substantial headwinds that have caused us to revise \n      our expectations for the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McKim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First, we are off to a very \n      slow start to the year due to the severe winter weather. In the U.S. we \n      have seen a significant level of weather-related temporary branch \n      closures year-to-date and we are experiencing elevated maintenance and \n      fuel costs resulting from the severe cold temperatures in Canada and the \n      U.S. Second, the recent decline in the Canadian dollar is positioning us \n      for lower revenue and Adjusted EBITDA due to the translation of our \n      Canadian operations into U.S. dollars. Our revised 2014 guidance \n      reflects a translation impact of $100 million in revenue and $15 million \n      in Adjusted EBITDA. Third, the posted market price of Group 2 lubricants \n      was reduced in mid-January by 25 to 30 cents per gallon by the refining \n      majors, which is affecting our sales and profits for both base oil and \n      blended products. Our pricing on our re-refined products is below last \n      year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level at this time. Fourth, the near-term forecast for land \n      exploration spending in North America is expected to be considerably \n      lower than historical. As the number one provider in this marketplace, \n      we are experiencing a sizeable slowdown in activity in our seismic \n      business, accelerating a trend that began for us late in the fourth \n      quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to the combination of these factors, we anticipate a slower start \n      to 2014 and are lowering our full-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA \n      expectations accordingly. In addition, we are providing first-quarter \n      guidance to help investors better understand the seasonality of our \n      revenue and profitability in 2014. The first quarter is typically one of \n      our seasonally weakest quarters, and that will be exacerbated this year. \n      However, through our comprehensive cost-reduction programs and margin \n      enhancement initiatives, we are confident that we can achieve a \n      significant improvement in our margins as the year progresses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McKim \n      said.Based on its 2013 financial performance and current market conditions, \n      Clean Harbors is revising its previously announced 2014 annual revenue \n      and Adjusted EBITDA guidance. The Company currently expects 2014 \n      revenues in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, compared with its \n      previous guidance of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. For 2014, the Company \n      now expects Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $525 million to $555 \n      million, compared with its previous guidance of $610 million to $640 \n      million. A reconciliation of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adjusted EBITDA guidance to \n      net income guidance is included below.For the first quarter of 2014, the Company expects revenue in the range \n      of $820 million to $840 million. The Company expects to generate \n      Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2014 in the range of $100 \n      million to $105 million.Company to Lower Cost Structure\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are aggressively responding to our underperformance and current \n      market conditions with a wide range of cost reduction programs with the \n      goal of substantially lowering our cost structure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McKim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beyond \n      the synergies we achieved from the Safety-Kleen acquisition in 2013, we \n      have set a target of further reducing our cost structure by an \n      additional $75 million. We have also launched a broad array of margin \n      improvement initiatives in areas such as our pay-for-oil program, \n      maintenance and network optimization. Collectively, these efforts will \n      enable us to address the margin pressure we are experiencing due to \n      adverse conditions in several of our markets. We are also launching a \n      broad strategic review of our operating structure with an emphasis on \n      driving organic growth and improving our return on invested capital \n      after a number of acquisitions have helped to more than triple our size \n      over the past five years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdStock Buyback ProgramClean Harbors also announced today that its Board of Directors has \n      authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of its common stock. The \n      Company intends to fund the repurchases through its available cash \n      resources.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have confidence in our long-term corporate strategy. Despite some \n      near-term challenges in several of our markets, we firmly believe in the \n      Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential for profitable growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McKim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our strong \n      balance sheet and consistent cash generation affords us the financial \n      flexibility to implement this stock repurchase, which delivers value to \n      our shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe repurchase program authorizes Clean Harbors to purchase its common \n      stock on the open market from time to time.\u00c2\u00a0The share repurchases will \n      be made in a manner that complies with applicable U.S. securities laws. \n      The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases will \n      depend on a number of factors, including share price, cash required for \n      future business plans, trading volume and other conditions. The Company \n      has no obligation to repurchase stock under this program and may suspend \n      or terminate the repurchase program at any time.Non-GAAP ResultsClean Harbors reports Adjusted EBITDA results, which is a non-GAAP \n      financial measure, as a complement to results provided in accordance \n      with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States \n      (GAAP). The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional \n      useful information to investors since the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loan covenants are \n      based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved. The Company defines \n      Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with its existing credit agreement, as \n      described in the following reconciliation showing the differences \n      between reported net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter \n      and full-year 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2For the three months ended:\u00c2For the year ended:December 31, 2013\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2December 31, 2012\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2December 31, 2013\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2December 31, 2012\u00c2Net income$26,801$61,874$95,566$129,674Accretion of environmental liabilities2,9132,50811,5419,917Depreciation and amortization67,54544,852264,449161,646Other expense (income)325337(1,705)802Loss on early extinguishment of debt\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u201d26,385Interest expense, net19,59213,45178,37647,287Pre-tax, non-cash acquisition accounting inventory adjustment\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u201d13,559\u00e2\u20ac\u201dProvision (benefit) for income taxes12,159(39,431)48,319(1,944)Adjusted EBITDA$129,335$83,591$510,105$373,767Adjusted EBITDA Guidance ReconciliationAn itemized reconciliation between projected net income and projected \n      Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\u00c2For the Quarter Ending March 31, 2014Amount\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2Margin % (1)(In millions)\u00c2Projected GAAP net income$ 4\u00c2to$ 90.5%to1.1%Adjustments:Accretion of environmental liabilities3to30.4%to0.4%Depreciation and amortization70to688.5%to8.1%Interest expense, net20to202.4%to2.3%Provision for income taxes3\u00c2to50.4%\u00c2to0.6%Projected Adjusted EBITDA$ 100\u00c2to$ 10512.2%\u00c2to12.5%\u00c2Revenues (In millions)$820to$840\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2For the Year Ending December 31, 2014Amount\u00c2\u00c2Margin % (1)(In millions)\u00c2Projected GAAP net income$ 96\u00c2to$ 1222.7%to3.4%Adjustments:Accretion of environmental liabilities13to110.4%to0.3%Depreciation and amortization280to2758.0%to7.6%Interest expense, net80to792.3%to2.2%Provision for income taxes56\u00c2to681.6%\u00c2to1.9%Projected Adjusted EBITDA$ 525\u00c2to$ 55515.0%\u00c2to15.4%\u00c2Revenues (In millions)$3,500to$3,600\u00c2\u00c2(1) The Margin % indicates the percentage that the line-item represents \n      to total revenues for the respective reporting period, calculated by \n      dividing the dollar amount for the line-item by total revenues for the \n      reporting period.Conference Call InformationClean Harbors will conduct a conference call for investors today at 9:00 \n      a.m. (ET) to discuss the information contained in this press release.

(TSX.V:CYD)(\"Cayden\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce results from the Company's ongoing Phase 1\n core drilling program at its 100% optioned El Barque\u00c3\u00b1o Gold Project in\n Jalisco State, Mexico.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Drilling highlights include 44 meters of 2.34\n g/t Au in hole 37 and 23 meters of 2.43 g/t Au in hole 28. These holes\n extend the prospective mineralization previously encountered in holes 3\n and 4 (please see attached map and table below).The first 37 of 41 holes at the Azteca target area have tested\n approximately 1.2 km of the 2.2 km prospective strike length to date\n with a maximum true depth of 200 meters. All the holes drilled in the\n Azteca target, with the exception of two holes, have penetrated the\n mineralized structures and have intersected significant gold\n mineralization.Table 1 - Drill results from the Azteca target area at El Barque\u00c3\u00b1o\n (BDD00037 = hole 37):HOLEFromToWidth (m)Au (g/t)Ag (g/t)Cu %BDD00265061110.482.90.02BDD0026757942.47.20.23BDD002710211080.517.20.11BDD00285982232.433.50.03BDD00292434101.234.20.09BDD0029112119.57.50.845.40.14BDD0030182570.812.00.15BDD00317090200.537.50.45BDD0032no significant intercepts\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2BDD00334052122.026.20.08BDD0034555833.894.30.04BDD00347590151.365.80.10BDD0035465262.844.70.06BDD0036313980.756.20.15BDD00374488442.3411.10.15Cayden has completed its Phase 1 drilling program at the Azteca target\n with a total of 41 holes drilled totaling 6,336 meters, 4 holes are\n currently pending assay. The Azteca drill results received to date\n indicate continuous mineralization throughout multiple structures along\n with several areas that contain significantly larger widths and grades\n at fault intersections. The Azteca target remains open along strike in\n both directions and at depth; a second phase of drilling is being\n designed to expand drilling along the projected strike length and will\n commence once permits are received.The Company is moving the drill to its Pena d'Orotarget where Cayden's\n technical team has had the opportunity to discover some exceptional\n surface results which include trenches both within historic workings\n and beyond them along strike (see news release fromAugust 22nd, 2013).Ivan Bebek, President and CEO commented: \"We are very pleased with the\n results to date from the Phase 1 drill program at our Azteca target and\n look forward to a second phase program which we believe will\n considerably expand the mineralization along strike and at depth. We\n are also excited to begin an initial drill program at the Pe\u00c3\u00b1a d'Orotarget that will commence shortly. In the past six months, our\n technical team has done an exceptional job of exploring just over half\n of the three El Barque\u00c3\u00b1o concessions primarily at surface with the\n exception of drilling at the Azteca target. The results of the\n exploration and the interpretation of the geology is starting to reveal\n district scale exploration potential with a pipeline of 8 additional\n outcropping targets.\"Cayden will be attending the PDAC Mining Convention inToronto, Ontarioand will have two booths for Session A (Sunday March 2andMonday March\n 3), Booth #2421A is in the Investor Exchange and Booth #5001 is located\n inside the Core Shack. President and CEO,Ivan Bebekwill also be\n giving a 15 minute presentation on Exploration and Development onTuesday, March 4at10:20amin room 803AB. We welcome anyone registered\n for the PDAC or inTorontoto please come and join us.Qualified Person-David Hladky, P. Geo. is the Qualified Person with respect to NI\n 43-101 at Barque\u00c3\u00b1o. All core is drilled at HQ diameter and is sawed or\n split into equal halves on site. All samples are assayed using standard\n 30 gram fire assay with atomic absorption finish by Acme Labs inVancouver, BC. QA/QC programs using internal standard samples, field\n and lab duplicates, re-assays, and blanks indicate good accuracy and\n precision in a large majority of standards assayed. As the mapped\n mineralized corridors strike EW to ENE, the drill holes were designed\n to have azimuths perpendicular or close to perpendicular to the strike.\n As this is the first drill program by Cayden, the dips of the\n mineralized structures are not entirely known. However, based on\n mapping and previous drilling, all intercepts released herein are\n believed to be 60-100% of true width. Intercepts are calculated\n assuming a bulk-mining scenario, with a width cutoff of 5 meters and\n grade cutoff of 0.5 g/t Au (intercepts of 3-4 meters width are also\n stated if they exceed 5 m * Au g/t grade widths). No intercepts were\n reported that averaged less than 0.5 g/t Au (rounded) and no intercepts\n have more than five consecutive meters of less than 0.2 g/t.About Cayden Resources- Cayden is a junior mining company focused on delivering shareholder\n value through the acquisition, exploration and development of precious\n metal projects inMexico.

(here)In short, as the amount of money the industry as a whole is given to manage rises, its ability to outperform fails to grow due to more competition.The paper, which analyzed actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds, also found that funds with high turnover, higher volatility and those which specialize in small-cap shares all see diminishing returns as the industry grows in size.What is truly ironic is that the data shows that active managers are adding more alpha, or outperformance, over time.Whereas the average fund in 1979 was producing 24 basis points of outperformance attributable to skill per month, that figure rose to 42 basis points in 2011. Among the top 10 percent of managers by skill, extra monthly added value rose from 98 basis points in 1979 to 123 in 2011.So if managers are getting better and better, how is it that their relative results are getting worse and worse? Much of this is driven by size. The authors estimate that for every 1 percent increase in industry assets under management, active funds suffer a loss of between 20 and 40 basis points of performance per year.\"We argue that the growing industry size makes it harder for fund managers to outperform despite their improving skill. The active management industry today is bigger and more competitive than it was 30 years ago, so it takes more skill just to keep up with the rest of the pack.\"Take for example small-cap funds. Thirty or 40 years ago there were fewer such funds, and fewer analysts covering those companies. That created a happy hunting ground for those few who did invest in small caps. But as their numbers swelled, much of that advantage was arbitraged away.GO YOUNG, YOUNG MAN?The data suggests, the authors say, that new funds entering the industry are more skilled, on average, than existing funds. Younger funds are also outperforming older funds. In fact if you divide the fund universe into groups by age, funds up to three years old beat those which are more than 10 years old by a statistically meaningful 0.9 percent per year. Funds which are three to six years old also outperform the aged.This trend is also seen within the life cycle of an individual fund, with performance tending to deteriorate as the fund ages, which somewhat undermines arguments that choosing a fund with a long-established track record is a good strategy.But before you go out and fire your old funds, note that the authors find younger funds are capturing some of that outperformance in the form of higher fees.So why are younger funds better performers? The authors speculate that it may be because younger managers are better educated, or more able to use new technology. The technology argument makes some sense. Funds based on new technology designed to exploit algorithms and low-latency trading would have been both new, and like the small-cap funds of long ago, facing a playing field with little competition.Those easy pickings, however, may well be competed away over time.It also seems likely, to me at least, that new funds are more willing to try new techniques or strategies, and thus are doing a better job of finding small areas where there are pricing anomalies which can be profitable.As we observe all the time at the company level, it is a lot easier for a new entrant to try something new and radical than it is for an established incumbent. In the same way, existing funds tend to have an investment, at least psychologically, in how they've always done things.As those advantages are eroded by a growing industry, these older funds are perhaps less likely to adapt.(James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

ARC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, which \n      builds on more than a decade of groundbreaking research in oral \n      immunotherapy by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s academic and non-profit collaborators, \n      aims to establish allergen desensitization treatment protocols and \n      supply treatment products for clinical use. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead product, \n      now in Phase 2b development, is a standardized formulated peanut protein \n      designed for gradual, controlled up-dosing and ongoing maintenance \n      dosing to dramatically increase the threshold at which patients show an \n      allergic reaction to peanuts. This and subsequent ARC products would \n      address an urgent and growing unmet medical need: while the prevalence \n      and social impact of food allergies continues to increase, current \n      treatment options are limited to emergency measures post-reaction.

Cynapsus' drug candidate, APL-130277, is an easy-to-administer, fast-acting reformulation of apomorphine, which is the only approved drug (in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries) to rescue patients from \"OFF\" episodes. Cynapsus is focused on maximizing the value of APL-130277 by completing pivotal studies in advance of a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") expected to be submitted in 2016.Over one million people in the U.S. and an estimated 4 to 6 million people globally suffer from Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts motor activity, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. Based on a recent study and the results of the Company's Global 500 Neurologists Survey, it is estimated that between 25 percent and 50 percent of patients experience \"OFF\" episodes in which they have impaired movement or speaking capabilities. Current medications only control the disease's symptoms, and most drugs become less effective over time as the disease progresses.More information about Cynapsus (TSX VENTURE:CTH)(OTCQX:CYNAF) is available atwww.cynapsus.caand at the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) atwww.sedar.com.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

The ETNs are also subject to certain investor fees, \n      which will have a negative effect on the value of the ETNs.For more information regarding the ETNs, including the calculation of \n      the coupon amount, see the prospectus relating to the ETNs. The \n      prospectus relating to the ETNs can be found on EDGAR, the SEC website, \n      at:www.sec.gov. \n      The prospectus is also available on the product website atwww.ETNplus.com.Selected Risk ConsiderationsAn investment in any ETNs linked to the Atlantic Trust Select MLP Index \n      (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ETNs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here, but we \n      urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under \n      \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risk Factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing \n      supplement.You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal:The ETNs are exposed \n      to any decrease in the Volume Weighted Average Price (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153VWAP\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) level \n      between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. \n      Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to offset the negative \n      effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose \n      some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if \n      the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an \n      investor fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will \n      always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the \n      index components.The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt \n      securities and have no principal protection.Credit of Barclays Bank PLC:The ETNs are unsecured debt \n      obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either \n      directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third \n      party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at \n      maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC \n      to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and \n      perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market \n      value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, \n      in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you \n      may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.Issuer Redemption:Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to \n      redeem or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153call\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole \n      discretion and without your consent on any trading day on or after the \n      inception date until and including maturity.The Payment on the ETNs is Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the \n      Closing Level of the Index and Not to the Published Intraday Indicative \n      Value of the ETNs:Your payment at maturity or upon early redemption \n      is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as compared to the \n      initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to track the \n      performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is different \n      from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index. \n      Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may \n      be different from the payment you would receive if such payment were \n      determined by reference to the official closing level of the Index.No Guaranteed Coupon Payments:You are not guaranteed to receive \n      coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a coupon payment on a \n      coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued dividend exceeds \n      the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation date. The \n      amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends in \n      part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference \n      holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index \n      constituents prior to the relevant coupon valuation date.Market and Volatility Risk:The return on the ETNs is linked to \n      the performance of the VWAP level of the Index which, in turn, is linked \n      to the performance of the master limited partnerships and other \n      securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The \n      prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a \n      result, affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in \n      unforeseeable ways.Concentration Risk:The index constituents are companies in the \n      Energy Sector or Gas Utilities Sector, as determined by the GICS\u00c2\u00aeclassification system. In addition, many of the index constituents are \n      smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to the risks \n      associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital funding \n      to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger, \n      better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are \n      susceptible to general market fluctuations in the energy and gas MLP \n      market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market \n      confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. \n      Your investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated \n      securities investment in one industry or sector.A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop:Although the ETNs \n      are listed on NYSE Arca, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop \n      and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to \n      maintain any listing of the ETNs.Restrictions on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for \n      Redemptions:You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in \n      order to exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. \n      You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption date if we receive a \n      notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times as set forth in \n      the pricing supplement.Tax Treatment:Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the \n      ETNs may be less favorable than a direct investment in MLPs and are \n      uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax \n      situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration statement (including a \n      prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication \n      relates.

Some provinces rely on choice and competition within the public system while others rely more on independent schools to provide choice.Public schoolsTotal enrolment in public schools in Canada ranges from a low of 87.5 per cent of students in British Columbia and Quebec to a high of 98.8 per cent in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. Too often, however, observers falsely equate high public school enrolment with lack of parental choice and competition.For instance, Alberta and Ontario offer a great deal of parental choice within the public school system. Both provinces provide four fully-funded public education systems: English public, French public, English Catholic, and French Catholic. Additionally, Alberta, unlike any other province, also fully funds charter schools.In contrast, British Columbia, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces offer only two choices within the public school system-English and French public schools, although second language schools are quite limited except in New Brunswick.Independent schoolsEnrolment in independent schools varies from a low of 0.9 per cent of students in New Brunswick to a high of 12.5 per cent in Quebec, while B.C. (12.1 per cent), Manitoba (7.4 per cent), Ontario (5.1 per cent) and Alberta (4.6 per cent) also have active independent school systems. Parents outside of Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan (which all fully fund certain types of religious schools, mainly Catholic) must look to the independent school system for religious education.Financial support for independent schools varies by province and also contributes to enrolment disparity. All four western provinces and Quebec partially fund the operating costs of independent schools. Ontario and the Atlantic provinces provide no public funding for independent schools. And no province provides capital funding.Home schoolingWhile all 10 provinces permit home schooling, Alberta, which provides $1,641 per home school student, has the highest percentage of home school enrolment (1.6 per cent). In most other provinces, home school enrolment sits below 0.5 per cent.School choice 2\"Because provinces have autonomy over education, the degree of school choice and competition varies across Canada. Parents in Alberta enjoy choice in both the public and independent school systems, Ontario relies largely on the public system, while Quebec and B.C. rely more on independent schools. And unfortunately for parents in the Atlantic provinces, they're afforded the least educational choice and competition in Canada,\" Clemens said.Follow the Fraser Institute onTwitter-Like us onFacebookThe Fraser Institute is an independent Canadian public policy research and educational organization with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal and ties to a global network of 86 think-tanks.

This is a\nbill we have to foot ourselves. The full amount will therefore\nbe paid by Rabobank and no one else, especially not the\ntaxpayer,\" he said.The search for a permanent successor to Moerland, who quit\nin October, is still in progress, Minderhoud said.Rabobank, the country's second-largest bank by assets after\nING, said net profit fell 2 percent to 2.012 billion\neuros in 2013. It said it expected operating results to improve\nthanks to cost savings, while impairments on real estate and\nland holdings and provisions would be lower this year.On top of the Libor fine, Rabobank was hit by an 817 million\neuro loss at its real estate business because of impairments and\nrevaluations, substantially increasing provisions in the second\nhalf to reflect the deterioration of the quality of the\nportfolio.Those were partly offset by a 1.6 billion euro gain from the\nsale of its fund management business, Robeco, to Japanese\nfinancial services firm Orix Corp and a positive impact\nfrom pension changes.Rabobank, a mutual lender that finances Dutch cheese and\ntulip producers, was stripped of its coveted triple-A credit\nrating from Standard & Poor's in late 2011.It divested Sarasin and Robeco, its private banking and fund\nmanagement businesses, to bolster its capital buffers, and has\nagreed to sell its Polish unit, Bank BGZ, to BNP\nParibas for about 1 billion euros. The Polish\nfinancial regulator was quoted this month as saying it would not\nrule on the deal before August.Rabobank Chief Financial Officer Bert Bruggink appeared\nconfident approval would be given.\"The Polish regulators sent us supplementary questions in\norder to be satisfied about the stability of the banking system\n... which is a perfectly usual thing to do,\" Bruggink said on a\nconference call with reporters.\"I don't think we can say that the Polish government is\nputting up all kinds of barriers for us that would make it\nimpossible to close the deal,\" he said.Rabobank has announced sweeping job cuts, branch closures\nand reductions in remuneration packages to save about 1 billion\neuros in costs.About 8,000 domestic retail banking jobs will go by 2016 -\nreducing the headcount in those operations by nearly a third to\n20,000 from 28,000, while Rabobank said it would close about 300\nout of the 800 or so existing branches of its member banks. \n ($1 = 0.7317 euros)\n\n (Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Tom\nPfeiffer and Susan Fenton)"], "2014/02/27/research-and-markets-idUSnBw276697a+100+BSW20140227": ["Research and Markets: Small Arms Manufacturing Industry - 2014 Edition Report Features Players such as Colt Defense Inc. and Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation", "2014/02/27", "Research and Markets: Small Arms Manufacturing Industry - 2014 Edition \n      Report Features Players such as Colt Defense Inc. and Smith & Wesson \n      Holding CorporationResearch and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mvmgkc/small_arms) \n      has announced the addition of Supplier Relations US, LLC's new report\"Small \n      Arms Manufacturing Industry in the U.S. and its International Trade \n      [2014 Edition]\"to their offering.The industry's revenue for the year 2012 was reported at $3.3 billion \n      USD, with an estimated gross profit of 36.94%.

Europe, however, offers\nglimmers of hope as economic recovery is expected to accelerate,\nconsumers switch to optic fibre and superfast 4G mobile\nconnections, and regulators could allow consolidation to take\nplace, potentially reducing price wars.\"We expect Spanish (operating income) to continue to improve\nwhile the company benefits from European consolidation in the\nUK, Germany and possibly also Spain going some way to offset\ndowngrades that are likely to come from weak Latin American\ncurrencies and another Venezuelan devaluation,\" said Berstein\nanalysts in a note.Revenues came in at 57.06 billion euros ($77.98 billion), in\nline with a Reuters forecast for 56.99 billion euros, and\noperating income (OIBDA) was 19.08 billion euros, down 10.1\npercent but also in line with a forecast 18.96 billion euros.Net profit jumped 16.9 percent to 4.59 billion euros, after\nfalling in 2012 due to steep writedowns.Other analysts, though, were more cautious on any prospect\nof a quick turnaround in mature European markets as the cost of\nbuilding up new networks will initially pressure results and\nfierce competition between operators will keep hitting revenues.Shares in Telefonica were down 2.5 percent at around 1340\nGMT, underperforming both Spain's blue-chip Ibex index \nand European peers.CAPEXTelefonica has been involved in a price war in its Spanish\nhome market since it launched an aggressive quadruple-play offer\nbundling together mobile and fixed telephone, Internet and TV\nservices more than a year ago.This has eroded traditionally high margins and pressured\nprofits, which the company hopes to recover thanks to new,\npremium data and TV services.As with European peers Vodafone, Orange \nand Deutsche Telekom, however, Telefonica will have\nto spend billions of euros in building up new optic fibre and\nsuperfast 4G mobile networks to carry these offers.It raised its objective of capEx/sales ratio to 15.5-16\npercent this year compared to 14.5 percent in 2013.The move was made possible by the completion of its\ndebt-cutting plan. Net debt dropped to 45.38 billion euros at\nthe end of 2013, beating a goal to get it below 47 billion\neuros.It said it would reduce it below 43 billion euros by\nyear-end and reiterated it hoped to make savings worth 1.5\nbillion euros by centralising the majority of its business units\nunder a single manager based in Madrid.In a sign that it would remain financially prudent ahead of\nexpected market consolidation in Europe and Latin America,\nTelefonica also said 0.35 euro of its unchanged 0.75 euro per\nshare dividend would now come in the form of shares compared\nwith an all-cash payout in 2013.Telefonica Deutschland said it expected to receive\nobjections on Wednesday from the European Commission to its 8.6\nbillion euro acquisition of KPN's German E-Plus unit.Telefonica is also in the middle of a strategy review in\nBrazil, where it has been given until mid-2015 by the local\nregulator to loosen its grip on the local market.Both moves are closely watched as possible triggers for a\nwave of mergers and acquisitions involving the world's biggest\ntelecoms operators.Chairman Cesar Alierta said he was confident that what he\ncalled existing, outdated telecoms regulations would be updated\nin order to create single digital telecoms markets in Europe,\nLatin America and the rest of the world.\"This is going to make a tremendous difference for revenues\nand the value chain in the near future,\" he said. \"And this is\ngoing to happen very soon.\""], "2014/02/27/dc-brand-usa-board-idUSnPnPHvHGhP+16d+PRN20140227": ["Brand USA Announces Quarterly Board Meeting and New Board Appointees", "2014/02/27", "WASHINGTON,Feb. 27, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0The next BrandUSAboard meeting will be held onWednesday, March 19, 2014.

The system identifies plaques suspected to be vulnerable to \n      rupture, which can cause a fatal coronary blockage. Current methods of \n      diagnosing coronary artery disease are limited in their ability to \n      detect such plaques.Coronary artery plaques are caused by the build-up of cholesterol and \n      other materials inside the walls of the coronary arteries.

The TVC Imaging System helps interventional \n      cardiologists identify which patients are prone to complications during \n      stenting. The device enables cardiologists to predict the risk of \n      peri-procedural heart attacks by assessing not only the degree of \n      stenosis, but also the presence and extent of lipid-core plaques (LCP).The device is the only multimodality imaging system to combine both \n      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). \n      Through IVUS technology, the TVC Imaging System provides clear and \n      relevant information about vessel structure, in real time. The TVC \n      Imaging System is the only device specifically approved in both the U.S. \n      and Europe for the detection of LCPs. NIRS measurements have been made \n      in over 5,000 patients in over 100 hospitals worldwide.About Infraredx, Inc.Infraredx, Inc. is a privately-funded medical device company dedicated \n      to helping provide practitioners with the information needed for \n      enhanced clinical decision making in treating coronary artery disease. \n      The company is committed to improving the safety and efficacy of \n      coronary stenting and ultimately serving as part of a strategy to \n      prevent initial coronary events.Through its TVC Imaging System\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, Infraredx is changing the way coronary \n      artery disease is diagnosed and treated.

INC.Non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliationsTo supplement Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consolidated financial statements, which are \n      prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting \n      principles in the United States (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153GAAP\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), Splunk provides investors with \n      certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, \n      non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP \n      operating margin and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (collectively \n      the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-GAAP financial measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). These non-GAAP financial measures \n      exclude stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll tax expense \n      related to employee stock plans, the change in fair value of certain \n      preferred stock warrants previously issued by Splunk, impairment of a \n      long-lived asset, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired \n      intangible assets and the partial release of the valuation allowance due \n      to acquisitions. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures include free \n      cash flow, which represents cash from operations less purchases of \n      property and equipment. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial \n      measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a \n      substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and \n      presented in accordance with GAAP. Splunk uses these non-GAAP financial \n      measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a \n      means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Splunk believes that \n      these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about \n      Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past \n      financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater \n      transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its \n      financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP \n      financial measures facilitate comparisons to competitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operating \n      results.Splunk excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash \n      in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental \n      information regarding Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational performance. In particular, \n      because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective \n      assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under \n      FASB ASC Topic 718, Splunk believes that providing non-GAAP financial \n      measures that exclude this expense allows investors the ability to make \n      more meaningful comparisons between Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating results and those \n      of other companies. Splunk excludes employer payroll tax expense related \n      to employee stock plans in order for investors to see the full effect \n      that excluding that stock-based compensation expense had on Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      operating results. These expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of \n      underlying equity awards and the price of Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common stock at the \n      time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period \n      independent of the operating performance of Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business. Splunk \n      excludes expense attributable to the change in fair value of certain \n      preferred stock warrants from its non-GAAP financial measures because it \n      is a non-recurring, non-cash expense. Splunk also excludes the non-cash \n      charge for previously capitalized Storm research and development expense \n      (reflected as an impairment of a long-lived asset) as a result of its \n      strategic decision to start making its Storm product available at no \n      cost to customers, a decision that Splunk expects to be infrequent in \n      nature. Splunk also excludes acquisition-related costs and amortization \n      of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures \n      because they are considered by management to be outside of Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core \n      operating results. Splunk further excludes the partial release of the \n      valuation allowance due to acquisitions from non-GAAP net income (loss) \n      and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share because it is also considered \n      by management to be outside Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core operating results. \n      Accordingly, Splunk believes that excluding these expenses provides \n      investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying \n      performance of its business operations, facilitates comparison of its \n      results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the \n      results of other companies in its industry. Splunk considers free cash \n      flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to \n      management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the \n      business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including \n      investing in its business, making strategic acquisitions and \n      strengthening its balance sheet.There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the \n      non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, \n      may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      competitors and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon \n      Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation \n      expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a \n      significant recurring expense in Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and an important part \n      of the compensation provided to Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees. The non-GAAP \n      financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction \n      with, GAAP financial measures.The following table reconciles Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-GAAP results to Splunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      GAAP results included in this press release.\u00c2\u00c2SPLUNK INC.Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures(In thousands, except per share data)(Unaudited)\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2Three Months EndedFiscal Year EndedJanuary 31,2014January 31,2013January 31,2014January 31,2013\u00c2Reconciliation of cash provided by \n            operating activities to free cash flow:Net cash provided by operating activities$34,429$24,791$73,848$46,648Less purchases of property and equipment\u00c2(2,043)\u00c2(3,357)\u00c2(9,308)\u00c2(9,077)Free cash flow (Non-GAAP)$32,386\u00c2$21,434\u00c2$64,540\u00c2$37,571\u00c2Net cash used in investing activities$(22,823)$(3,357)$(39,046)$(8,563)Net cash provided by financing activities$533,971\u00c2$11,176\u00c2$556,699\u00c2$236,235\u00c2\u00c2Gross margin reconciliation:GAAP gross margin88.8%89.8%88.2%89.2%Stock-based compensation expense2.60.81.70.6Employer payroll tax on employee stock plans0.1-0.1-Amortization of acquired intangible assets0.6-0.2-Impairment of long-lived asset\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c20.7\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2Non-GAAP gross margin\u00c292.1\u00c2%\u00c290.6\u00c2%\u00c290.9\u00c2%\u00c289.8\u00c2%\u00c2Operating income (loss) reconciliation:GAAP operating loss$(32,484)$(5,924)$(78,307)$(22,033)Stock-based compensation expense33,2448,25769,36819,480Employer payroll tax on employee stock plans2,1148933,9711,155Amortization of acquired intangible assets770-906-Impairment of long-lived asset--2,128-Acquisition-related costs\u00c2314\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c2722\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2Non-GAAP operating income (loss)$3,958\u00c2$3,226\u00c2$(1,212)$(1,398)\u00c2Operating margin reconciliation:GAAP operating margin(32.5)%(9.1)%(25.9)%(11.1)%Stock-based compensation expense33.312.722.99.8Employer payroll tax on employee stock plans2.11.41.30.6Amortization of acquired intangible assets0.8-0.3-Impairment of long-lived asset--0.7-Acquisition-related costs\u00c20.3\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c20.3\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2Non-GAAP operating margin\u00c24.0\u00c2%\u00c25.0\u00c2%\u00c2(0.4)%\u00c2(0.7)%\u00c2Net income (loss) reconciliation:GAAP net loss$(32,631)$(6,162)$(79,008)$(36,681)Stock-based compensation expense33,2448,25769,36819,480Change in fair value of preferred stock warrants---14,087Employer payroll tax on employee stock plans2,1148933,9711,155Amortization of acquired intangible assets770-906-Impairment of long-lived asset--2,128-Acquisition-related costs314-722-Partial release of the valuation allowance due to acquisitions\u00c2(427)\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c2(1,174)\u00c2-\u00c2Non-GAAP net income (loss)$3,384\u00c2$2,988\u00c2$(3,087)$(1,959)\u00c2Reconciliation of shares used in \n            computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:Weighted-average shares used in computing GAAP basic net loss per \n          share108,04798,996105,06780,246Effect of dilutive securities: Employee stock awards and ESPP\u00c210,685\u00c2\u00c216,619\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2\u00c2-\u00c2Weighted-average shares used in computing Non-GAAP basic and diluted \n          net income (loss) per share\u00c2118,732\u00c2\u00c2115,615\u00c2\u00c2105,067\u00c2\u00c280,246\u00c2\u00c2GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share$(0.30)$(0.06)$(0.75)$(0.46)\u00c2Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income (loss) per share$0.03\u00c2$0.03\u00c2$(0.03)$(0.02)\u00c2For more information, please contact:Splunk Inc.Sherry \n      Lowe, 415-852-5529slowe@splunk.comorInvestor \n      ContactSplunk Inc.Ken Tinsley, 415-848-8476ktinsley@splunk.com"], "2014/02/27/wa-nintendo-idUSnBw275541a+100+BSW20140227": ["Nintendo News: Nintendo Download Highlights New Digital Content for Nintendo Systems", "2014/02/27", "Nintendo News: Nintendo Download Highlights New Digital Content for \n      Nintendo SystemsThis week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nintendo Download includes the following featured content:Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DSProfessor \n            Layton and the Azran Legacy\u00e2\u20ac\u201c TheProfessor Laytonseries couples brilliant puzzle games with a fascinating story to \n            create a riveting formula that has provided great entertainment \n            for mystery fans and puzzle-solving gurus alike.

The board has ruled repeatedly, when Democrats voiced support for unions, that public officials properly exercised their right to free speech, he said.\"I hope that the NLRB will understand and realize the magnitude of what they are going to be deciding and in no way will try to muzzle public officials who are community leaders from expressing their point of view,\" he said during a meeting with reporters organized by the Christian Science Monitor.Corker noted that President Barack Obama had also waded into the fight by accusing skeptical politicians of being \"more concerned about German shareholders than American workers.Corker said he spoke out to counteract misinformation from the auto workers union. \"The UAW had been spreading rumors that the only way a new SUV line was going to come to the plant and double its size, the only way that was going to happen was if the plant was organized by the UAW,\" he said.The UAW denies that organizers allowed into the plant in the week ahead of the vote's start said anything about needing a union vote result to bring the new product to the Chattanooga plant. Union officials say they have been consistent in saying the result of the vote would not affect VW's decision on where to place the new product.Corker did not answer when asked if VW officials were the source of his comment about the company's plans for the SUV line.He reiterated his harsh criticism of the UAW, among other things accusing it of trying to organize in Tennessee only to raise more dues money to shore up its flagging finances.\"I think it was very apparent the UAW was in Chattanooga for one reason - dollars,\" Corker said.(Additional reporting byBernie Woodallin Detroit; editing by Stephen Powell andMatthew Lewis)"], "2014/02/27/us-japan-economy-output-idUSBREA1Q2F120140227": ["Japan January industrial output up 4.0 percent month on month", "2014/02/27", "TOKYO(Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose 4.0 percent in January, marking a second straight month of gains, government data showed on Friday, as companies ramped up production of cars and other goods to meet rising demand before a sales tax hike in April.The month-on-month gain compared with economists' median forecast for 3.0 percent growth and followed a 0.9 percent increase in December, the data from the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry showed.Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 1.3 percent in February but decrease 3.2 percent in March.The ministry maintained its assessment that industrial output is picking up.To view the full tables, click on the METI websitehere(Reporting byTetsushi Kajimoto; Editing byChris Gallagher)"], "2014/02/27/us-britain-hacking-idUSBREA1Q17K20140227": ["Ex-Murdoch UK editor Brooks: 'I sanctioned payments to officials'", "2014/02/27", "LONDON(Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks, Rupert Murdoch's former British newspaper boss, told a London court on Thursday she had sanctioned payments to public officials \"half a dozen times\" but denied approving the illegal sums for which she is on trial.Brooks is accused of authorizing almost 40,000 pounds ($66,000) in illegal payments from a reporter on Murdoch's Sun tabloid to a Ministry of Defence (MoD) official while she was editor of the paper.She denies a charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office, and other offences of conspiracy to hack phones and perverting the course of justice.Furor over phone-hacking by journalists at the News of the World tabloid, which she also edited, led to the closure of the paper in 2011, rocked Murdoch's media empire and had repercussions across the British political establishment.However, the offence relating to authorizing illegal payments carries a potentially much lengthier jail sentence.Giving evidence for a fifth day at London's Old Bailey court, Brooks said \"there had to be an overwhelming public interest\" to justify payments to officials and only in \"very narrow circumstances\".Asked by her defence lawyer if she had ever sanctioned such payments, which is illegal, Brooks replied: \"Yes, probably since I was deputy editor of the Sun, 1998 to 2009, a handful of occasions, half a dozen.\"\"CHEAP AT THE PRICE\"Brooks was asked about a series of stories she approved that the prosecution says relate to illegal payments by a Sun journalist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to an MoD official.Brooks said she had not known who the reporter's source was, nor that she was a public official. \"He probably should have brought it to my attention, absolutely,\" she said.The jury were also shown emails from the reporter asking Brooks to authorize payments to his \"number one military contact\", to which she replied: \"Of course\".\"Nothing would have flagged up to me that there was an issue with it,\" she told the court, adding she would not have been \"policing\" the reporter for any wrongdoing.In one email, the reporter described a 4,500 pound ($7,500) payment for three of his stories as being \"cheap at the price\".\"I probably thought, yeah that's quite cheap at the price,\" she said.Brooks said there was legitimate public interest in many of the stories and, although she had been unaware who the source was at the time, she hypothetically would have sanctioned payments for a few of them.These related to reports of bullying of army recruits and a \"war hero\" quitting over the treatment of his troops.\"This was exactly the kind of campaign we were doing,\" she said. She told the jury there had been no reaction or complaint from the MoD about the stories or their origin, although the paper's campaigns had caused some political disquiet.CRUEL AND HARSH ATTACK\"We did get some complaints from one source, that was the (then) Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he didn't like it obviously, it wasn't good for him,\" said Brooks, who said Murdoch had given her the Sun job partly because of her zeal for campaigning.Earlier Brooks, who edited Murdoch's News of the World and Sun tabloids from 2000 to 2009, told the court she had made lots of errors and regretted some stories and headlines.\"I personally made lots of mistakes\", said the 45-year-old, who ran News Corp's British paper arm until 2011.One case where she said she had \"gone too far\" was a personal attack on former Labour minister Clare Short over her opposition to daily pictures of topless models on page three of the Sun, a traditional feature of the paper since 1970.The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily, had responded by publishing a doctored photograph of Short bare-breasted and accused her of being \"jealous\".Brooks said this had been \"cruel\" and \"harsh\". \"It was just too personal, it was just wrong,\" she added.Her trial and that of six others continues.(Editing byStephen AddisonandTom Heneghan)"], "2014/02/27/idUSnGNX86XMqV+1cd+GNW20140227": [0, "2014/02/27", "CONTACT: Endurance International Group\n         Dani LaSalvia\n         press@endurance.com\n         +1 (781) 852-3212"], "2014/02/27/idUSnGNX4TmYvK+1d5+GNW20140227": [0, "2014/02/27", "NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --WHAT:Liquid Holdings Group, Inc.

Fitch Ratings has also assigned an \n      'A+(bra)' rating to Magnesita's debentures issuance of BRL400 million \n      due 2018. The issuance proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt. \n      The corporate Rating Outlook is Stable.A full list of ratings is provided below.KEY RATING DRIVERS:Solid Business Profile; Vertical Integration:Magnesita's ratings are supported by its low-cost and vertically \n      integrated business model, allowing for an industry-leading EBITDA \n      margin close to 15% on EBITDA of BRL376 million during the last 12 \n      months ended Sept. 30 2013. The company's core business is refractory \n      solutions, comprising 89% of BRL2.5 billion in revenues during the \n      period, followed by its services business line (6%), and its minerals \n      segment (5%). The ratings are also backed by the company's long-life \n      mine reserves, geographical diversification, position as the world's \n      third largest refractory manufacturer in a highly fragmented market, and \n      strong liquidity profile. The company has strong long-term relationships \n      with customers throughout the world, having exported their products to \n      over 75 countries in 2013. As of Sept. 30, 2013, the company had \n      approximately 850 customers, including the largest Brazilian steel \n      producers, as well as leading Brazilian and international cement \n      producers.Resilient EBITDA Margins; High Exposure to Steel SectorThe company has a customer concentration in the cyclical steel industry, \n      which accounted for 73% of consolidated revenues in 2013. Magnesita has \n      been able to maintain stable EBITDA margins despite the volatile results \n      of the steel sector since 2008, although its large exposure to this \n      sector has resulted in modest organic growth with LTM EBITDA generation \n      of BRL376 million at Sept. 30, 2013 compared to BRL339 million in 2011. \n      Magnesita plans to diversify its revenues through its minerals segment \n      by expanding into profitable graphite sales in order to increase sales \n      volumes through geographical diversification. At present, the growth in \n      cement and industrial refractories has not yet materialized enough to \n      benefit operating cash flow generation. The global refractory industry \n      remains highly fragmented and Fitch expects consolidation to take place \n      in the future.Working Capital Pressures Free Cash Flow (FCF) in 2013, Expected to Be \n      One-Off EventChanges implemented in the company's commercial strategy during 2013 \n      pressured its working capital requirements. This was mainly related to \n      building-up inventory levels at new points of sales in regions such as \n      the Middle East and South East Asia. During LTM September 2013, working \n      capital needs increased to BRL136 million compared to BRL16 million in \n      2012. As a result, cashflow from operations (CFFO) reached a very low \n      BRL35 million in the LTM September 13, a significant decline from BRL175 \n      million reported in 2012.Fitch expects the low CFFO in 2013 to be a one-off event, improving to \n      around BRL180 million in 2014 under its Base Case. Higher capex has also \n      pressured Magnesita FCF generation in 2012 and during 2013. As of the \n      LTM to Sept. 30 2013, Magnesita exhibited FCF of negative BRL181 million \n      following capex of BRL199 million and dividends of BRL9 million. The \n      company ended 2012 with FCF of negative BRL101 million after capex of \n      BRL259 million and dividends of BRL17 million. This was a significant \n      decline from FCF of BRL246 million in 2011. The company's dividend \n      policy has remained conservative, at the minimum 25%.Leverage Peak in 2013; Improvements Expected in 2014Magnesita's cash balance eroded significantly during 2013 due to \n      negative FCF, a number of small acquisitions, and the discontinuation of \n      a joint venture operation in China. Compounding this was the BRL \n      devaluation which led to further deterioration in Magnesita's net \n      leverage ratios. As of Sept. 30, 2103, the company's total and net \n      adjusted debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratios, on a pro-forma basis including \n      acquisitions, were 5.3x and 4.2x, respectively, compared to 6.1x and \n      3.8x by year-end 2012. Fitch includes the company's post-employment \n      obligations of BRL254 million in Magnesita's total adjusted debt and \n      also BRL33 million as off-balance-sheet debt related to future \n      obligations from acquisitions. Foreign exchange risk for the company is \n      partially mitigated due to its geographic diversification, resulting in \n      approximately 70% of its 2013 EBITDA being generated in foreign currency \n      compared to 76% of its debt being denominated in USD and EUR.Fitch's Base Case indicates adjusted EBITDA generation at around BRL428 \n      million for 2014, with EBITDA margins around 15.5%. FCF is expected to \n      be negative by around BRL30 million following capex and dividends for \n      the year, with FFO interest coverage at about 1.7x and net adjusted \n      debt-to-EBITDA improving to around 3.8x. Refractories are expected to \n      continue to make up 88% of revenues, while services and minerals 6% of \n      revenues each.Strong Liquidity:Magnesita's liquidity position indicates comfortable headroom for the \n      rating category, ending Sept. 30, 2013 with BRL456 million of cash and \n      marketable securities compared to short-term debt of BRL75 million. \n      Short-term debt was just 4% of total adjusted debt of BRL2.1 billion for \n      the period. Liquidity ratios are strong with cash-to-short-term debt at \n      6.1x and cash plus CFFO-to-short-term debt at 4.8x. Magnesita's debt \n      amortization schedule is very manageable with BRL75 million of \n      short-term and BRL568 million spread over the next four years. The \n      company's cash position is enough to meet all current debt maturities \n      through 2017.Minerals Segment Expansion Still in Early Stages:Magnesita's strategy to diversify its revenues by expanding its other \n      business units, especially its minerals segment, should not materialize \n      prior to 2017. The potential to develop graphite sales is considerable \n      given the growing demand for this raw material for use in rechargeable \n      batteries coupled with export restrictions from China. Graphite is a \n      very profitable business opportunity for Magnesita in relation to the \n      company's low-cost position for production. Magnesita's capex plan \n      includes a project to develop its graphite output to 40,000 metric tons \n      per year by 2017, after which Fitch expects the minerals segment to \n      contribute 15%% of consolidated revenues.RATING SENSITIVITIES:A Negative Outlook or downgrade could take place following a prolonged \n      downturn in the cyclical steel and cement markets that hampers \n      production volumes globally to levels that severely affect the company's \n      financial performance.

It currently owns around 49 percent\nof the firm.\"We want to grow more outside of Spain,\" ACS Chairman\nFlorentino Perez told analysts. \"We have had some bad years,\nparticularly in the construction sector in Spain.\"FCC, which generates most of its earnings from services and\nwater treatment, made big writedowns on items including\nrenewable energy assets. Its full-year net loss for 2013 grew 47\npercent to 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion), year-on-year.The company scaled back profit targets for the coming years\ndue to massive provisions of 1.68 billion euros. Its shares\nclosed down 8.5 percent, the biggest percentage loss among\nSpanish blue-chips on Friday.Sacyr, fresh from reaching a preliminary deal between its\nconsortium and the Panama Canal to finish work on the widening\nof the waterway, reported a net loss of 496 million euros, half\nthe loss registered in 2012.Sales at Sacyr fell 10 percent, while the company made\nwritedowns on real estate assets and renewable energy assets.\nThe Panama Canal project had a negative impact of 124 million\neuros on 2013 net profit, the company said.The project had been fraught with disputes about costs since\nthe beginning of 2014 and work was halted for two weeks while\nthe parties tried to come to an agreement.ACS, meanwhile, swung back into the black in 2013 with a net\nprofit of $702 million after making a writedown on its\ninvestment in power utility Iberdrola in 2012.It increased sales in its services units for business such\nas recycling and street cleaning. Water treatment was the only\nbusiness unit that registered a rise for FCC.MOMENTUMHowever, cuts in spending by Spanish councils meant that\nprices and profits were falling for these kinds of activities,\nsaid Jose Lizan, fund manager at Auriga Securities with 30\nmillion euros of assets under management including a small\namount of ACS shares.\"Cash-strapped town halls are trying to get cheaper prices\nfor contracts up for renewal and this will affect profit\nmargins,\" he said.The Bank of Spain said spending on public works rose in 2013\nfor the first time since the crash five years ago. But investors\nsay it will take time for any uptick to register on companies'\naccounts.Spain accounted for 14 percent of sales at ACS, 58 percent\nat FCC and 47 percent at Sacyr in 2013.Shares in Spanish builders have lost about 80 percent of\ntheir market value since 2007 but they put on a good performance\nin 2013, with Sacyr leading the pack - up 140 percent compared\nwith a 21 percent rise in Spain's blue-chip index.FCC made headlines in recent months when billionaire\ninvestors Bill Gates and George Soros bought into its shares.Lizan of Auriga Securities said the shares of builders would\nhave a hard time keeping up momentum this year until a timid\neconomic rebound is reflected in improved sales. Spain emerged\nfrom recession in the second half of the year.\"They are all about restructuring, it's a case of buying on\nthe cheap,\" said Lizan.\"Selling assets and paying down debt will make a more nimble\ncompany, better placed for an economic upturn, that's the idea.\nBut this will happen much more slowly than the jumps in the\nshare prices would have you believe.\"ACS, FCC and Sacyr made progress on cutting debt piles,\ntrimming them by a combined 3.8 billion euros during the year.FCC, in the process of restructuring about 5 billion euros\nof debt, said net debt fell 16 percent year-on-year to just\nunder 6 billion euros, reaching management's year-end target.Chief Executive Juan Bejar told analysts on Friday the firm\nhad no need for a rights issue and that it would hold back on\ndividend payments until it got its debt position under control.\n\n($1 = 0.7309 euros)\n\n (Reporting By Sonya Dowsett; Editing by Pravin Char)"], "2014/02/28/us-ukraine-crisis-un-idUSBREA1R20420140228": ["Ukraine's U.N. envoy:'We are strong enough to defend ourselves'", "2014/02/28", "UNITED NATIONS(Reuters) - Ukraine's U.N.

Security Council in a closed-door session on the escalating crisis in Ukraine.\"We are strong enough to defend ourselves,\" he said outside the council chamber.Armed men took control of two airports in Ukraine's autonomous Crimea region earlier on Friday in what the country's leadership described as an invasion and occupation by Russian forces. Russia denied involvement in the airport seizures.Ukraine had asked Lithuania, the president of the Security Council for February, to schedule Friday's meeting of the 15-nation body.\"Due to the deterioration of the situation in the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea, Ukraine, which threatens territorial integrity of Ukraine ... I have the honor to request an urgent meeting of the Security Council in accordance with Articles 34 and 35 of the U.N.

Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council and, therefore, able to block any proposed action by its members.\"I can't see Russia allowing this council to do anything in the way of condemning (ousted Ukrainian President Viktor) Yanukovich or what appears to be its own actions in Ukraine,\" a Western diplomat told Reuters.Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, who council diplomats said had wanted to delay the meeting to Saturday at the earliest, was asked on the way in what he thought the meeting would achieve.\"I have no idea,\" Churkin said.British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the meeting was \"an important opportunity to set out our concerns about developments particularly in the Crimea, also to call on all parties to de-escalate the situation and reduce the tension.\"Lyall Grant said it was a good chance \"to underline the importance we hope all member states attach to the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"Russia has criticized Ukraine's new government and voiced support for Yanukovich.The Ukrainian letter to Lithuania's U.N. ambassador came hours after Ukraine's parliament said it would appeal to the council to call a session to consider the problems in Ukraine in the light of a 1993 understanding in which the big powers agreed to guarantee Ukrainian territorial integrity.(Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk; Writing by Louis Charbonneau; Editing byJames Dalgleish, Gunna Dickson,Toni Reinhold)"], "2014/02/28/el-camino-hosp-cfo-idUSnPnSFwy9rs+160+PRN20140228": ["El Camino Hospital Announces Appointment of Iftikhar Hussain as Chief Financial Officer", "2014/02/28", "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.,Feb. 28, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- El Camino Hospital today announced that it has appointedIftikhar Hussainas the hospital's new Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\u00c2\u00a0 Mr. Hussain will replace interim CFO,Ned Borgstrom, starting in April.\"Iftikhar brings a proven track record of careful fiscal management, organizational leadership and innovative thinking that will be a tremendous asset to our hospital,\" saidTomi Ryba, president and CEO of El Camino Hospital.\u00c2\u00a0 \"The next couple of years will bring some exciting changes to El Camino Hospital that will allow us to better serve our patients and create greater operational and cost efficiencies.

Here are some of the tricks that veteran travelers have picked up on the road.1. Plan aheadHeather Holmes, who works for the medical device company Medtronic Inc, regularly puts in more than 100,000 miles a year on long flights to such places as China and India. She takes her preparations very seriously, starting as much as a month or two in advance.As soon as she knows her destination, Holmes - who's in her 30s - heads first to a travel clinic at a local hospital near her home base in Chicago. These can be found in many cities and dispense any needed vaccinations and medicines to deal with diseases specific to where you are traveling, such as anti-malaria drugs.If there's no clinic like this near you, you can get information about the risks of specific illnesses and diseases you might encounter by using free services including Sitata.com, the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (iamat.org), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's travel site (wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel).2.

A foot injury on a Greek island, where she had trouble finding pain medicine, cemented the idea for her about being prepared.Now she packs a hearty kit of over-the-counter medications and supplies, including hydro-cortisone cream, Benadryl, contact solution, wipes that can be used as a shower alternative, and zinc lozenges intended to lessen the duration of a cold.To avoid common digestive problems from foreign food that can be tricky to deal with in remote locales, she drinks bottled water when traveling and sticks mainly to packaged dry foods - including crackers, nuts and cereals. Still, Jackson says it's worth identifying where bathrooms are wherever you're going to be in case you are on the wrong side of that battle.Holmes' kit includes Band-aids, Benadryl, antiseptic ointment, hydro-cortisone, sleeping pills, moistened wipes, anti-bacterial hand wash, sunscreen, and bug spray. \"By traveling with all of this stuff I'm prepared for most anything that I could encounter on the ground or in the air,\" she says.Also, before a long flight, she says she takes aspirin and wears compression socks to prevent deep vein thrombosis - and she tries to walk around when possible.3. Eat rightFood, even before you go, can make a difference in how your hold up in your travels. Vegan chef and travel expert Carolyn Scott-Hamilton, also known as \"The Healthy Voyager,\" says to avoid alcohol, sugar and caffeine before flying - as well as to dodge \"junky, overpriced and unhealthy airport food.\"On trips, she brings an anti-microbial sleep mask and neck pillow to help catch some shut-eye while on the road, and snacks in stainless steel containers.4. Avoid germsSome veteran travelers make a point of using disinfectant on items they're likely to touch when traveling - such as hotel light switches, door handles and even the TV remote control.New York-based actor and comedian Jim Dailakis, who regularly travels between the U.S. and Australia says he exercises, eats well and gets plenty of sleep before hitting the road. But he also never forgets to keep his hands clean. \"Hand sanitizer is incredibly important to me. If I can't wash my hands with soap and water, I'll always use hand sanitizer.\"And when he does use a restroom, he uses the paper towel that he dried with to open the door. \"Some people might not wash their hands after they've gone to the bathroom,\" Dailakis says.5. Check your insuranceRobert Wheeler, chief medical officer for New Hampshire-based On Call International, a paid service that provides emergency travel assistance, says to check with your medical insurance company about what they would cover when you're abroad. It's also important to identify hospitals and pharmacies at your destination that have been identified as having Western standards.Wheeler puts a lot of emphasis on drinking plenty of water. He says he drinks between eight and 10 eight-ounce glasses of water a day before, during and after traveling because getting dried out makes the body less effective fighting off viruses and bacteria.(This story has been refiled to reformat URL ofiamat.org. in the sixth paragraph)(Editing byBeth Pinskerand Stephen Powell)"], "2014/02/28/db-x-trackers-ftse-xin-idUSnBw285477a+100+BSW20140228": [0, "2014/02/28", "Net Asset Value(s)FUND\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 db x-trackers FTSE China 25 UCITS ETFDEALING DATE\u00c2\u00a6 27-Feb-14NAV PER SHARE\u00c2\u00a6 USD 28.1403NUMBER OF SHARES IN ISSUE\u00c2\u00a6 8,309,247CODE\u00c2\u00a6DB X-Trackers - FTSE/XINHUA CHINA 25 ETF"], "2014/02/28/idUSnCCN5dJ85B+1c9+MKW20140228": [0, "2014/02/28", "GreenStar Agricultural Engages CHF Capital Markets for Media RelationsTORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 28, 2014) -GreenStar Agriculture Corporation (\"GreenStar\" or the \"Company\") (TSX VENTURE:GRE) today announced it has engaged CHF Capital Markets to provide media relations, effective immediately.\u00c2\u00a0CHF Capital Markets Inc. is a subsidiary of CHF Investor Relations, a highly regarded Canadian investor relations firm headquartered in Toronto and operating under the same management for the past twenty years.\"Now is the appropriate time to undertake a Media Relations Program for GreenStar as we are eager to let everyone know our story.

With a 0-60mph time of 7.4 seconds and a top speed of 143mph they deliver scintillating performance, but have also been tuned with everyday usability and civility in mind.Re-tuned suspension ensures both Kia cee'd GT's are more than capable of handling the impressive power and torque outputs. Increased damper rebound and compression rates, stiffer springs and bushes and a larger rear anti-roll bar are joined by stylish 18-inch alloy wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres.The steering has been tuned for a more direct and sporting feel and the Flex Steer function, which allows drivers to select from three levels of power assistance in other versions of the Kia cee'd car, has been removed for the GT. The brakes - 300mm ventilated discs at the front and 262mm at the rear - are the most powerful ever fitted to the Kia cee'd range.The already sporty lines have been embellished with performance-car additions which give the Kia cee'd GT models their own unique look, and it is the same story for the high-quality interior.T-GDi - turbocharging and direct injectionThe 1.6-litre 'Gamma' engine is the first turbocharged petrol unit to be offered by Kia in the UK. The addition of an exhaust-driven turbocharger raises the power output of the normal Gamma direct-injection engine by 51 per cent and the amount of torque it develops by 61 per cent for truly exciting performance.The T-GDi (Turbocharged Gasoline Direct injection) engine develops its 201bhp at 6,000rpm, but what really gives the Kia cee'd GT car model its instantaneous response and rapid acceleration is the 265Nm of torque available without interruption from 1,750rpm to 4,500rpm. The Kia cee'd GT accelerates from 37 to 60mph in fourth gear in only 5.4 seconds and from 50 to 75mph in fifth gear in 7.3 seconds - indicators of the supreme flexibility and immediacy of the T-GDi engine. More than 80 per cent of maximum torque is available from less than 1,500rpm.Performance benefits from the integration of the twin-scroll turbocharger into the exhaust manifold, a design which improves responsiveness - eliminating the 'turbo lag' between the driver pressing the accelerator and the turbocharger building up boost pressure - while simultaneously improving gas flow and reducing heat losses for maximum efficiency. The Kia cee'd GT hatchback may be first and foremost a performance car, but it also contributes towards Kia's goal of improving the average fuel economy and exhaust emissions of Kia's new car model range thanks to the combination of small engine capacity, direct fuel injection and exhaust-driven turbocharging. The combined fuel consumption is 38.2mpg, while CO2 emissions are 171g/km.The engine drives through a slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission featuring revised ratios and a lower final drive to allow the GT to make the most of its torque with minimal fuel consumption.Dressed to thrill: GT gets a unique look inside and outFor the Kia cee'd GT car model, the already sporty and athletic lines of the cee'd have been layered with visually exciting additions at the front, rear and sides.The unique front-end treatment, echoing that of the Kia pro_cee'd GT hot hatch, introduces a lower, broader bumper and air dam and a wide central lower air intake to supply additional cooling air to the high-performance turbocharged engine. This is underscored by a red trim line which emphasises the wide and sporty track. The lower air intake is flanked on either side by high-gloss black inserts housing 'ice-cube' LED daytime running lamps and foglights. The high-gloss black theme is continued on the graphite chrome-framed main radiator grille - with Kia's family 'tiger-nose' outline. The grille includes a smart 'GT' badge on the black high-gloss mesh.From the rear, the broad stance is evident in the bold shoulders. This is emphasised by a diffuser section in the lower edge of the rear bumper, separating the dual sports exhaust outlets. The rear number plate is framed in high-gloss black and straddled by a vertical reversing light and reflectors, while the combination lamp units are LEDs which give a unique signature at night and when braking. There is a 'GT' badge on the tailgate.The side profile of the Kia cee'd GT hatchback is given even greater sense of purpose by bold side sill mouldings and special graphite grey 18-inch alloy wheels tightly encased by the bodywork. Red brake calipers front and rear are a clear sign of the performance credentials, while the premium quality is emphasised by a chrome strip running around the side windows, and the electrically folding and heated mirrors with LED indicator lights.The performance-oriented exterior design is echoed inside the all-black five-seat cabin. The driver and front passenger are gripped by Recaro sports seats - as in the Kia pro_cee'd GT car- adorned with 'GT' and 'Recaro' logos. Power-adjustable lumbar support is fitted to both front seats. The upholstery is part leather and part suede, and there is red contrast stitching on the seats, steering wheel, gear shifter and door trims. The leather steering wheel also features perforated grip areas and an overstitched 'GT' logo, and there are stainless steel pedals with non-slip rubber inserts. High-gloss black features on the air vent surrounds, front console tray and door trims, adding a premium flourish which is echoed in the stainless steel kick plates on the door sills.Kia's familiar three-dial sporty instrument layout is enhanced by a TFT LCD multi-function high-definition display which allows the driver to switch between analogue-type or GT performance digital information. The latter shows the car's speed, engine torque, turbo boost pressure and engine coolant temperature as well as important trip information. It can display speed in miles per hour or kilometres per hour. A 'GT' button on the steering wheel allows the driver to change the display without taking a hand off the wheel.Two trim linesThere are two extensively equipped variants - 'GT' and 'GT Tech'. The 'GT' is the entry-level version, yet it comes with anything other than a base-level specification. The exterior benefits from a number of sporty styling touches including new front and rear bumper designs, side sill mouldings, dual exhausts, 'ice-cube' LED daytime running lights and 18-inch graphite grey alloy wheels with red brake calipers.On the inside the Kia cee'd GT car receives Recaro seats, finished in leather and suede, with power lumbar adjustment. Red stitching is applied to the leather steering wheel and gear knob, and there is black headlining and high-gloss black trim garnish.Providing driver comfort and convenience are a host of standard items, including air conditioning, cruise control with a speed limiter, automatic lights, cornering lights, reversing sensors, Bluetooth phone connectivity with music streaming and voice recognition, a six speaker radio/CD player with iPod connectivity, a unique 'GT' TFT LCD display, electric windows, electrically operated and heated folding mirrors with puddle lights and privacy glass on the rear windows and tailgate.The comprehensive safety specification includes Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Vehicle Stability Management (VSM), Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), anti-lock brakes (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist (BAS), six airbags with a cut-off switch for the front passenger's seat, a seat-belt reminder warning, impact-sensing door unlocking and ISOFIX child-seat mounting points.The Kia cee'd GT Tech car adds a seven-inch touchscreen with satellite navigation, European mapping and full UK postcode recognition; a reversing camera display integrated into the navigation screen; heated front seats and a heated steering wheel; and an engine start/stop button with a smart entry system. Also standard are exterior door handle illumination, rain-sensing front wipers, dual-zone automatic air conditioning with an ioniser, an automatic de-fog system, an automatic-dimming rear-view mirror and Xenon adaptive headlights with headlight washers and automatic levelling in place of the cornering lights on the Kia cee'd GT car.Warranty and servicingThe Kia cee'd GT, like every Kia car, comes with a seven-year, 100,000-mile fully transferable warranty. Servicing is required every 12 months or 10,000 miles, whichever comes soonest. Retail customers are able to take advantage of Kia's Care-3 and Care-3 Plus all-inclusive servicing packages, which provide inflation-proof routine maintenance for the first three or five services respectively. Both are fully transferable to subsequent owners.TECHNICAL FIGURESDimensions & WeightsGTGT TechLength (mm)4,310Width (mm, exc. mirrors)1,780Height (mm)1,470Wheelbase (mm)2,650Track - Fr./Rear (mm)1,545 / 1,553Overhang - Fr./Rear (mm)900 / 760Min Kerb Weight (kg)1,359Max Kerb Weight (kg)1,448Boot vol.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. A \n      complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSLow-Cost Polymetals Miner:Cash flow generation at Milpo has historically been robust due to its \n      competitive position on the cost curve. Milpo's consolidated cash cost \n      of production improved to USD35 per metric ton (mt) of treated ore in \n      2013 from USD36.11 per mt in 2012 following an operational efficiency \n      optimization program that included a streamlining of expenses. As a \n      result, the company improved its EBITDA margin to 36% in 2013 from 29% \n      in 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q'13) the average price of \n      silver declined by 36.4% compared to 4Q'12, while prices of base metals \n      such as zinc and copper decreased by 2.2% and 9.6%, respectively, over \n      the same period. In contrast to this trend, lead prices demonstrated a \n      price increase of 5.1% year-over-year.The company is a diversified, low-cost polymetals miner majority-owned \n      by Votorantim Participacoes S.A. of Brazil (VPAR, LT FC IDR \n      'BBB'/Negative) with zinc accounting for 41% of 2013 revenues, followed \n      by copper 33%, silver 19%, lead 6% and gold 1%. These revenues were \n      mainly generated by the company's three mines located in Peru, with the \n      largest mine, Cerro Lindo, accounting for 66% of revenues during 2013 \n      followed by El Porvenir 19% and Atacocha 14%. Two mines that produced \n      copper cathodes matured reaching the end of their mine life and were \n      suspended: Chapi (Moquegua-Peru) in 2013 and Ivan (Antofagasta-Chile) in \n      2012. Milpo's largest customer in 2013 was Glencore, accounting for 54% \n      of revenues, followed by Votorantim Metais (29%) and Trafigura (16%). \n      The company enters into five-year supply contracts that have \n      historically been renewed.Strong Cash Flow Generation to Partially Fund Capex Plan:Reflecting the cost optimization program and more cautious approach to \n      growth capex at a time of lower metal prices, the company generated \n      positive free cash flow (FCF) of USD87 million in 2013 following modest \n      capex with a focus on Brownfield projects of USD84 million, and no \n      dividends paid from the prior year's net profit. This compared to FCF of \n      negative USD70 million in 2012 following capex of USD248 million (of \n      which approximately USD170 million related to expansion), and USD7 \n      million of dividends. Milpo's investment plan of USD1.4 billion to \n      expand production and modernize facilities has been extended further \n      than the originally targeted completion date of 2017, due to lower \n      commodity prices. The change in the company's growth strategy followed \n      the appointment of the company's CEO, Victor Gobitz in June 2013. Mr. \n      Gobitz previously held positions at Rio Alto and Volcan Compania Minera \n      S.A.A. (Volcan, FC LT IDR 'BBB-'/Stable), and has a technical background \n      in mining.Going forward, under the lower price scenario, Milpo will be focused on \n      Brownfield projects for its current operations and the development of \n      Greenfield projects in phases depending on cash generation. Capex will \n      continue to be partially funded by internal cash flows, with the \n      shortfalls funded by additional debt but maintaining a conservative \n      leverage level. Fitch's Base Case for Milpo uses the agency's \n      conservative mid-cycle price assumptions and indicates that EBITDA will \n      decline to around USD210 million in 2014 due to zinc prices at USD1,900 \n      per mt and copper prices at USD7,000 per mt. This includes Fitch's \n      expectation of an increase in volumes at the Cerro Lindo and Atacocha \n      mines following the plants' optimization programmes. As a result, FCF is \n      close to neutral in 2014, trending negative by around USD40 million in \n      2015 to 2016 as capex and dividend payments begin to increase.Conservative Leverage Profile and Robust Liquidity:Milpo exhibits a conservative capital structure with funds from \n      operations (FFO) adjusted leverage of 1.9x and net debt-to-EBITDA of \n      0.2x at December 2013. These ratios compare to FFO adjusted leverage of \n      1.1x and net debt-to-EBITDA of 0.7x in 2012. Milpo's net debt-to-EBITDA \n      ratio decreased in 2013 mainly as a result of higher EBITDA and cash \n      post issuance of its USD350 million 4.625% senior unsecured notes due \n      2023 last year. Projected leverage remains strong for the rating \n      category in the Base Case with total debt-to-EBITDA never exceeding 2.0x \n      and net debt-to-EBITDA never exceeding 1.5x. FFO adjusted leverage is \n      expected to be around 2.0x in 2014.Milpo's liquidity position is strong. At December 2013, the company held \n      USD342 million of cash and marketable securities versus short-term debt \n      of USD20 million, a coverage ratio of 16.6x. A portion of the proceeds \n      from the USD350 million senior unsecured notes issuance refinanced \n      USD179 million of Milpo's bank debt in March 2013, extending its debt \n      maturity schedule to 10 years, with the rest of the notes balance held \n      as cash. The company relies primarily on strong internal cash flow \n      generation to meet its operational requirements, but also benefits from \n      good relationships with local and international financial institutions. \n      In addition, Milpo benefits from access to commercial advances from its \n      key clients.Revenues, EBITDA and Margin Improvements in 2013 vs 2012:Milpo's revenues for 2013 increased to USD720 million from USD696 \n      million in 2012 due to the increase in metal production off-setting the \n      price decline. EBITDA increased to USD257 million in 2013 from USD204 \n      million in 2012 due to higher production levels at the Cerro Lindo unit \n      at a lower production cash cost. Fitch expects Milpo to improve its \n      EBITDA margins closer to historical levels of around 40% when new, more \n      profitable projects come into production in 2017. The erosion in the \n      company's 2012 EBITDA margin when compared to 2011 (29.5% vs. 43.2%) was \n      due to a 10% price decline for the metals that Milpo produced over the \n      past two years, and the negative EBITDA contributions from the closure \n      of the copper mines Chapi and Ivan. The cost associated with the closing \n      of operations at Chapi and Ivan had a negative impact on EBITDA in 2012 \n      of USD40 million.As of 2013, Milpo had six years of mine life and 19 years of reserves \n      and resources according to the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code, \n      considered relatively low for the rating category as per Fitch's metals \n      and mining Sector Credit Factors. Offsetting this, the company has a \n      strong track record of replacing the reserves mined each year, and is \n      growing its resources. Milpo has been granted a total of 352,969 \n      hectares of mining concessions in Peru (89%) and Chile (11%), of which \n      53% are 28 prospects in the initial exploration stage, 31% are 12 \n      targets in the scoping study, resources definition, and drilling stage, \n      9% are three key advance projects - Hilarion, Magistral and Pukaqaqa - \n      under pre-feasibility, and 7% are the main three operating mines, Cerro \n      Lindo, El Porvenir and Atacocha.Rating Linkage Supported by Strong Legal and Operational Ties:Milpo is listed as a 'Material Subsidiary' for the cross-default and \n      acceleration provisions on approximately BRL11.4 billion of Votorantim \n      debt as of Dec. 31. 2012. Accordingly, Fitch links Milpo's credit \n      strength to that of its parent. Parental support from VPAR to Milpo is \n      considered very strong, as financial weakness at Milpo could trigger \n      cross-defaults for VPAR. Operationally, Milpo supplied 45% of total zinc \n      concentrate volumes to Votorantim Metais' Cajamarquilla zinc refinery \n      and contributed 37% of Votorantim Metais' EBITDA during 2012. Votorantim \n      Metais consolidates 100% of Milpo because of the majority ownership.Milpo is a key component of VPAR's metals and mining strategy to \n      significantly grow their metals and mining division, Votorantim Metais. \n      Milpo's location in Peru and its position as a local mining company \n      provides VPAR with favorable access to Peru's abundant geological \n      resources and vibrant market. Milpo is a low-cost producer of zinc, \n      ranking 10th in size on a standalone basis globally in 2011, with broad \n      asset diversification in Peru and Chile. Combined, Milpo and Votorantim \n      Metais ranked as the world's fifth largest producer of zinc in 2011. \n      Votorantim Metais has invested USD720 million in Milpo since 2005.RATING SENSITIVITIESMilpo's ratings benefit from its majority ownership by VPAR because of \n      its strong operational and legal ties, based on Fitch's Parent and \n      Subsidiary linkage criteria. Should the current level of operational and \n      legal ties change as a result of Votorantim divesting its ownership \n      stake in Milpo, then a rating action based on Milpo's standalone credit \n      profile could follow.If Milpo encountered operational and financial difficulty, Fitch would \n      expect Votorantim to take steps to demonstrate support of its \n      subsidiary. Precedents for Votorantim assisting companies where it has a \n      significant investment stake exist, such as with the recapitalization of \n      Fibria (VPAR owns 29.34% of common stock) with BNDES during 2010. Should \n      such support not be forthcoming, a rating downgrade could take place.Milpo's ratings would also be downgraded following a rating downgrade of \n      VPAR.Fitch affirms the following ratings of Milpo:--Local currency IDR at 'BBB';--Foreign currency IDR at 'BBB';--USD350 million, 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023 at 'BBB'.The Rating Outlook is Stable.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.Applicable Criteria and Related Research:--'Corporate Rating Methodology' (Aug. 5, 2013);--'Evaluating Corporate Governance' (Dec. 12, 2012);--'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage' (Aug. 5, 2013);--'Initiating Mid-Cycle Metals Price Assumptions, (Sept. 14, 2012).Applicable Criteria and Related Research:Initiating Mid-Cycle Metals Price Assumptionshttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=681333Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkagehttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=685552Corporate Rating Methodology: Including Short-Term Ratings and Parent \n      and Subsidiary Linkagehttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=715139Evaluating Corporate Governancehttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=694649Additional DisclosureSolicitation Statushttp://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=822106ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND \n      DISCLAIMERS.

The shortfall affects individual commuters as well freight movement around the country.Over two-thirds of the 604,493 bridges in the United States were 26 years old or older as of 2010.Of the total bridges, 11.5 percent were structurally deficient, while 12.8 percent were functionally obsolete, it said, meaning they did not meet current design standards.Spending on public transit systems including rail and buses was also falling behind.The report indicated that as much as $24.5 billion was needed per year to improve the condition of transit rail and bus systems. In 2010, total spending was $16.5 billion.Some transit systems were running rail cars more than 30 years old, but the report found that over 75 percent of needed repairs affected other facets of transit systems, such as rail stations, trestles, and power substations.The department's \"conditions and performance\" report, given to Congress every two years, came days after U.S. President Barack Obama announced a four-year, $302 billion plan to repair the country's crumbling roads and bridges.The proposal, which relies on tax reform for funding, was not expected to gain traction on Capitol Hill.Congress faces a September 30 deadline to renew federal funding for transportation programs and the Highway Trust Fund that helps pay for road and bridge projects on the verge of insolvency.(Reporting byRos Krasny; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"], "2014/02/28/ireland-nama-idUSL9N0F801E20140228": ["Ireland's NAMA to redeem 3 bln euros in senior bonds", "2014/02/28", "DUBLINFeb 28 (Reuters) - Ireland's National Asset\nManagement Agency (NAMA), the country's state-run \"bad bank\",\nwill redeem 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in senior bonds\nwithin the next two weeks, it said on Friday.NAMA is one of the world's largest property groups and\npurged Irish banks of risky loans worth 74 billion euros\nfollowing a property crash that pushed the country into a\nbailout three years ago.The agency said it expects to redeem about another 3 billion\neuros in senior bonds before the ened of 2014 and would make a\nfirst coupon payment, of 84 million euros, on its subordinated\ndebt.With Ireland having left its bailout and the economy and\nhousing markets starting to recover, NAMA will now offer a  \npackaged portfolio for sale each quarter with a minimum value of\n250 million euros to sustain momentum in the Irish market.\"NAMA hopes to be in a position whereby close to 50 percent\nof its senior debt of 30.2 billion euros will be redeemed by\nyear-end.

Mother Nature briefly let up and the teams traded goals in both the second and third periods before Bozak ended the wild affair by snapping a low shot past United States Olympic goaltender Jimmy Howard and inside the left post.James van Riemsdyk, who joined teammate Phil Kessel on the U.S. roster, scored while playing in his third Winter Classic and Jonathan Bernier made 41 saves for the Maple Leafs, who have won three in a row and improved 4-0-2 in their last six games. Captain Dion Phaneuf notched a pair of assists, one day after signing a seven-year, $49 million contract extension.Daniel Alfredsson scored in his return from back spasms and former Michigan State star Justin Abdelkader backhanded home a centering feed to forge a tie with 5:32 remaining in the third period. Defenseman Brendan Smith set up both tallies and Howard turned aside 24 shots for the Red Wings, who have dropped nine of its their last 12 (3-6-3).Detroit drew first blood by converting a 2-on-1 rush with 6:46 remaining in the second period as captain Henrik Zetterberg breezed in and wristed a centering feed that caromed off the right heel of Alfredsson and into the net. Van Riemsdyk answered from the right doorstep by batting the puck out of the air with 37 seconds left in the session before Bozak deflected Phaneuf's soft wrist shot from the left point to give Toronto as 2-1 lead at 4:41 of the third.GAME NOTEBOOK: Officials from Guinness World Records were on hand to verify that the contest surpassed the current mark of the 104,173 who attended the \"Big House\" when Michigan cruised to a 5-0 triumph over rival Michigan State on Dec. 11, 2010. The largest crowd to witness an NHL game was 71,217, which occurred during the 2008 Winter Classic at the home stadium of the Buffalo Bills. ... Prior to the game, Toronto traded Ds John-Michael Liles and Dennis Robertson to Carolina for veteran D Tim Gleason. Liles was a healthy scratch for the Winter Classic. ... Alfredsson's goal was his 11th of the season and 437th career, tying Hall of Famer Pavel Bure for 64th all-time in NHL history. ...

The weakened economic state of the UK following the recession of \n      2008/2009, as well as the ongoing migration of young readers onto online \n      platforms and the increased uptake of the Internet across UK households, \n      has also played a significant part in the decline of magazine print \n      circulations over the past few years.On a more positive note, however, the pre-teen magazine sector looks set \n      to recover, following a sharp contraction in sales during 2009 and 2010 \n      due to the recession, with market value rising by 4.1% in 2012 for this \n      particular category. This growth has been driven by a rise in the \n      population of children aged between 4 and 11 years old in the UK over \n      the past 3 years. The pre-teen sector has also benefitted from several \n      new magazine launches in recent years, with both Egmont and Immediate \n      Media Company introducing a range of new licensed titles targeted at \n      readers aged under 11 years old. A rise in digital investment by \n      publishers seeking to expand their digital portfolio of pre-teen \n      magazines has also helped to drive sales in this category in recent \n      years; with titles such as Doctor Who Adventures, Toxic and The Dandy \n      all launching as digital editions over the past couple of years in order \n      to appeal to the young and growing online audience.In contrast, the teenage magazine sector has continued to observe \n      year-on-year declines since at least 2008. The decline of this category \n      appears to have gone hand-in-hand with the rise of the Internet, with \n      tech-savvy teenagers continuing to migrate to online channels and social \n      networking sites in order to keep up with the latest trends and \n      fashions, and catch up on gossip. The rising uptake of \n      Internet-connected mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet \n      computers, among younger age groups has also fuelled this trend, with \n      teenagers now able to access news online at any time and from anywhere.As a result, traditional teenage magazines, which are generally \n      published on a weekly or monthly basis, have become somewhat defunct as \n      they are unable to compete with online news sites and social networks, \n      which provide up-to-the minute news and trends. However, there remains \n      some possibility for growth within this sector, with Cond\u00c3\u00a9 Nast \n      publishing two new teenage titles based on their mainstream portfolio \n      over the past couple of years, including Teen Tatler and Miss Vogue. The \n      move follows the highly successful launch of Teen Vogue in the US, and \n      represents an attempt to entice a younger audience to Cond\u00c3\u00a9 Nast's \n      portfolio of titles.Despite this, the authors estimate sales of teenage magazines to \n      continue to decline at a relatively steady rate over the next 5 years, \n      with the ongoing migration of teenagers onto online mobile platforms \n      likely to outweigh any success achieved by Cond\u00c3\u00a9 Nast's recent \n      introductions. However, the continued recovery of the pre-teen sector, \n      which is expected to benefit from increased investment from licensed \n      children's brands seeking to expand to new media channels, should help \n      to lift the overall market, with the authors estimating the total market \n      for pre-teen and teenage magazines to observe a small growth of 2.1% \n      between 2013 and 2017.For more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ctb6n7/teenage_andAbout Research and MarketsResearch and Markets is the world's leading source for international \n      market research reports and market data.

Other than the two losses to the Grizzlies, the Suns lost only two other games over the past month.Forward Zach Randolph led the Grizzlies with 20 points and 15 rebounds.Suns guard Goran Dragic scored a career-high 33 points and added seven assists.\"Memphis is not a good matchup for us,\" Dragic said. \"They have a lot of big guys under the rim, and they attack the paint.\"The Suns (19-12) played without guard Eric Bledsoe, who was a late scratch because of a right knee sprain. Gerald Green started in his place and scored nine points.The lineup change took away the Suns' chief advantage: the ability to play their dual-point-guard backcourt of Bledsoe and Dragic.Grizzlies guard Mike Conley, noting the battle of wills in establishing the teams' preferred tempos, said, \"It's tough to play at that pace. They practice that way. They play that way. It's not our style.\"The Grizzlies shut down the Suns' 3-point game (Phoenix shot just 8-for-30 from long range) while running up a monstrous 54-15 advantage in bench scoring. Memphis got key contributions from forward Ed Davis (8-for-11 for 16 points, plus 11 rebounds) and guard Jerryd Bayless (17 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter).The Grizzlies ran up a 57-44 lead early in the third quarter. The Suns then took off on an 18-0 run thanks to a series of driving layups, steals fast breaks, a spurt led by Dragic and forward P.J. Tucker.The surge gave the Suns a 62-57 lead, and they held a 73-69 advantage heading into the final quarter.\"We knew they'd make a run,\" Davis said. \"We just had to withstand it and make a last push.\"They did just that.The Grizzlies went on a 13-2 run to start the fourth, capped by a whirling fast-break layup by Davis that gave them an 82-75 lead. Moments later, Bayless nailed a 3-pointer to give Memphis a 94-84 lead. The Suns never threatened again.Bayless, who played in high school just a couple of miles from the Suns' arena, joked, \"A fan said that I had disgraced St. Mary's (High School). That hurt my feelings. That got me going a little.\"Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger said, \"They ran downhill on us....But I thought our guys showed a lot of character ... after taking a serious punch ... (and got) a very impressive win on the road.\"After the Suns took a 26-22 lead after the first quarter, the Grizzlies battered the Suns in the paint and took a 53-41 halftime lead. Thirty-eight of the Grizzlies' first-half points came in the paint. Meanwhile, the Suns were misfiring from long range, shooting just 2-for-11 on 3-pointers in the first half.NOTES: After the Suns went 10-3 in December, the NBA selected Jeff Hornacek as the Western Conference's coach of the month. \"I take it as a team award,\" Hornacek said. He became the first person to win coach and player honors for the same franchise. He was named player of the month for the Suns in December 1991. ... The Grizzlies defeated the Suns 110-91 on Dec. 3 in Phoenix. That sent the Suns to a season-worst 9-9. Phoenix won 10 of its next 13 games. ... The Suns came into the game 28-7 all-time vs. the Grizzlies in Phoenix, their best home winning percentage (.800) against any opponent. ... The Grizzlies acknowledge they are different than many teams in the generally high-scoring, up-tempo West. \"We are kind of the knuckleball,\" coach Dave Joerger said. \"We are built differently. We have to try to play from a lead.\" ... The Grizzlies continue to play without injured C Marc Gasol."], "2014/01/02/ca-first-mortgage-idUSnBw025858a+100+BSW20140102": ["Half Percent Home Loans Available in AZ, NV, NM, TX and UT via FMC", "2014/01/02", "HalfPercent Home Loans Available in AZ, NV, NM, TX and UT via \n      FMCLower-income borrowers in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah \n      can now buy a home for just one-half percent down payment thanks toFirst \n      Mortgage Corporation(FMC).

De Blasio, a\nDemocrat, most recently was the city's public advocate and,\nbefore that, served two terms in the city council.\"This will be first test, and he's got to pull it off as\nclose to flawlessly as he can,\" said Douglas Muzzio, a professor\nat Baruch College at the City University of New York. \"He's got\nto send the message, 'I can run this joint.'\"Storms have famously complicated the political lives of New\nYork mayors. In the winter of 1969, a storm that dropped 15\ninches (40 cm) of snow created a political crisis for Mayor John\nLindsay, who was faulted for the city's slow response.In 2010, Bloomberg came under fire for his handling of a\nblizzard that shut down some subway lines for days.\"If we see a situation worsening we're going to take very\naggressive action. So it's very much on our screens,\" de Blasio\ntold reporters this week.De Blasio, who is moving into the mayoral residence of\nGracie Mansion in Manhattan, asserted his outer-borough\ncredentials by mentioning that he remains a homeowner in the\nborough of Brooklyn.New York City consists of five counties known as boroughs:\nManhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.UNPLOWEDBloomberg, who was first elected as a Republican but dropped\nhis party affiliation, was criticized for letting snow pile up\nin Queens and allowing large parts of Brooklyn go unplowed for\ndays in 2010.Regardless of what Mother Nature sends the city's way, de\nBlasio has his work cut out for him as he kicks off his first\nweek in office.De Blasio has said one of his first acts will be to\ndismantle the horse-and-buggy industry in Central Park, which\nhas long been a tourist draw but has been the target of\nanimal-rights groups.Perhaps the defining issue of de Blasio's campaign for mayor\nwas the issue of stop and frisk, a police tactic that critics\nsay has led to racial profiling of young black and Latino men in\nlow-income neighborhoods.At the height of the Democratic primary last summer, de\nBlasio - who is white and whose wife, Chirlane McCray, is black\n- began broadcasting an ad that featured his mixed race son,\nDante, and spelled out de Blasio's criticism of the tactic.The ad boosted de Blasio's popularity among black and Latino\nvoters and helped push policing to the top of the debate.But first, de Blasio will have to quiet critics who say he\nlacks the management experience to be a great mayor.Muzzio predicted de Blasio would rise to the occasion.\"Those types of events, they're defining in a way that a\nlegislative victory is not,\" he said, adding half-jokingly:\n\"You'll see de Blasio riding a snow plow. There will not be a\nscrewup.\"\n\n (Reporting By Edith Honan)"], "2014/01/02/cyprus-broadcaster-blunder-idUSL6N0KC0Z620140102": ["RPT-Cyprus broadcaster airs ex-leader's message in New Year blunder", "2014/01/02", "(Repeats to more clients)NICOSIAJan 2 (Reuters) - Cyprus's public broadcaster\ninadvertently broadcast the opening seconds of an old New Year's\nmessage from the country's former leader instead of from\nPresident Nicos Anastasiades, prompting an embarrassed apology\non Thursday.The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) said it had\nrealised its mistake within seconds of the broadcast going out\non the afternoon of Dec. 31 and had halted transmission of the\naddress from former president Demetris Christofias.The broadcaster is now conducting an internal inquiry into\nthe \"very serious\" error, CyBC said in a statement carried by\nthe Cyprus News Agency.Christofias bowed out after Anastasiades won an election in\nFebruary 2013.\n\n (Writing byMichele Kambas; Editing byGareth Jones)"], "2014/01/02/ca-boost-mobile-idUSnBw025208a+100+BSW20140102": [0, "2014/01/02", "Boost Mobile Reunites with Motorola to launch Smart and Stylish Moto \n      G with NextRadioBoost \n      Mobile, a leader in the no-contract wireless industry with its \n      exclusive\u00c2\u00a0Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinking Payments, will\u00c2\u00a0debut \n      Moto G, by Motorola, a Google Company, on the HSN, HSN.com and HSN \n      mobile today, Jan. 2.

Industry experts said it could also produce ethanol\nwith sugar or sorghum.\"The ethanol sector is doing well lately, which is probably\nhelping deals get done; valuations on plants are pretty high\nright now,\" said Darin Friedrichs, an analyst at AgTraderTalk,\nciting ample U.S. corn stocks after a record large 2013 harvest\nand a 30 percent drop in corn prices in the past six months.Margins for U.S. ethanol makers rose to their highest in at\nleast five years recently as corn prices plunged.But if the Obama administration moves to cut mandated\nbiofuel use in the United States, further expansion is unlikely,\neven as the industry consolidates, analysts said.The EPA recommended reducing the biofuels mandate in\nNovember and the proposal now is under final review. For\ncorn-based ethanol, the agency proposed to cut the mandate to\nabout 13 billion gallons a year from around 14.4 billion.With the deal for the Mississippi plant, Bunge North\nAmerica's sole holdings in the U.S. biofuel industry is now a\nminority stake in a facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bunge\nLtd's chief executive said last year that the company also\nplanned to shed its Brazilian sugar-ethanol holdings.Also on Thursday, the owners of a 125-million-gallon per\nyear plant in Rochelle, Illinois, announced that it was for\nsale.

New Orleans ranked fourth in total offense.Foles threw for 27 touchdowns and two interceptions, and a league-leading passer rating of 119.2 after taking over as starter and directing the Eagles' No. 2 ranked offense.Besides passes, Brees and Foles could swap high school stories as the dueling quarterbacks share even more on their resumes having both attended Westlake High in Austin, Texas.Brees, who at 34 is 10 years older than Foles, marveled at the job his younger counterpart has done.\"Those are pretty impressive numbers, especially for a guy who's in his first year as a starter,\" Brees told reporters.\"I'm very happy for his success. Not just the fact that we're from the same high school and I kind of know the road he's traveled. But he seems like a tremendous young man.\"The contest will test the road readiness of the Saints, who were 8-0 in their climate-controlled Superdome home and 3-5 when playing in hostile environments.Philadelphia, after struggling at home, have run off four victories in a row at Lincoln Financial Field and won seven of their last eight games to snare the division crown.While the Saints, under new defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, ranked fourth in fewest yards allowed per game, they must deal with a balanced Eagles attack that also features the nifty running of LeSean McCoy, who led the NFL in rushing this year.New Orleans ranked 19th in the 32-team league defending against the run.Philadelphia wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who had 1,332 receiving yards this season, felt that being home could prove to be a strong advantage.\"Our fans are going to go wild,\" he said. \"It's a great opportunity to bring the playoffs to Philadelphia.\"(Reporting by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Frank Pingue)"], "2014/01/02/research-and-markets-idUSnBw025620a+100+BSW20140102": ["Research and Markets: Global Smart Water Management Market Report 2013 - 2018", "2014/01/02", "Research and Markets: Global Smart Water Management Market Report 2013 - \n      2018Research and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vsqb2l/smart_water) \n      has announced the addition of the\"Global \n      Smart Water Management Market Report 2013 - 2018\"report to \n      their offering.Utilities and governments across the globe are pressed with meeting the \n      increasing demand of quality water and maintaining the aging \n      infrastructure of water networks.Non-Revenue Water (NRW) accounts for a significant loss to water \n      utilities financially due to leaks, theft, and metering errors.

Resolutions you take for your community, and society as a whole, should be allocated measurable resources (example: two hours per week) and be mindful of the benefits they can bring to all beings.

Yakjin is a maker of clothing for U.S. companies Gap\n and Walmart.Many Western brands outsource manufacturing of footwear and\napparel to Cambodia, partly because labour there is cheaper than\nin China.The CNRP, led by former finance minister Sam Rainsy, has\ncourted some 350,000 garment workers from nearly 500 factories\nacross the country by promising to nearly double the monthly\nminimum wage to $160 if it wins a re-run of the July election,\nwhich Hun Sen is refusing to hold.CRISIS OVER WAGESThe opposition claims that 2.3 million of its votes were\nstolen to allow the ruling Cambodia People's Party (CPP) to\nreturn to office. The CPP won 68 seats in the election to the\nCNRP's 55, according to the National Election Committee, but the\nCNRP has said the commission is one of many agencies under the\ninfluence of the CPP.The government is refusing to raise the wage beyond $100\ndollars a month and has ordered factories to reopen. The garment\nindustry is worth $5 billion a year to Cambodia, one of the\nworld's poorest countries.Cheath Khemera, a senior labour officer at the Garment\nManufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), told Reuters it\nwas too soon to assess the cost of the strikes, but he estimated\neach factory could be losing $20,000 to $30,000 a day.\"This really impacts the industry seriously,\" he said.The United States said it deeply regretted the loss of life\nin the clashes and urged all sides to exercise restraint and\nshow respect for the rule of law.\"We condemn violence as a means to achieve political or\nother objectives,\" State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf said\nat a regular briefing.\"We have urged workers, unions and the government to work\ntogether towards a peaceful resolution of labour disagreements,\"\nshe said, adding that the United States was also engaging\ngarment exporters and buyers on the issue.\"We are urging respect for workers rights and safe working\nconditions in general,\" she said.Until this week, security forces had exercised restraint as\npressure mounted on a government facing some of the biggest\nprotests ever seen in Cambodia.The strikes and protests represent a rare challenge to the\n28-year rule of Hun Sen, who has been credited with attracting\ninvestment and creating jobs in the once failed state scarred by\nwar and the bloody 1970s Khmer Rouge era.He has also earned a reputation for being intolerant of\nopposition and rights groups have said abuses are common.Hun Sen's rule was tested last year when various opposition\nparties amalgamated and won votes from Cambodians upset by low\nwages, graft and a substantial number of forced evictions from\nfarmland and city slums.Garment manufacturing is Cambodia's biggest foreign currency\nearner. It is also a major employer and vital source of income\nfor many rural families who complain they can barely survive on\nthe wages, which are lower than in neighbouring Thailand and\nVietnam."], "2014/01/03/markets-canada-crude-idUSL2N0KD1LG20140103": ["Canada crude - Synthetic rises to four-month high", "2014/01/03", "* Feb synthetic trades at $2.50/bbl above WTI* Feb WCS trades at $20.00/bbl below WTICALGARY, AlbertaJan 3 (Reuters) - Light synthetic crude\nfrom the oil sands climbed to a four-month high on Friday, as\nsome traders bet that harsh weather in northern Alberta could\nhurt supply.Syncrude's oil sands operations in northern Alberta produced\nan average of 291,300 barrels per day in December, 10 percent\nless than the previous month, according to Canadian Oil Sands\nLtd, the project's largest-interest\nowner.Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for February\ndelivery rose to $2.50 per barrel above the West Texas\nIntermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers.That was the highest premium since late August and compares\nwith a settlement price of $1.60 per barrel above WTI on\nThursday.Temperatures in the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray have\nfluctuated between -38 degrees C and -5 C since Wednesday and\nare forecast to fall back to around -30 C over the weekend.\nMarket players in Calgary said those sharp swings could cause\nproblems with production.Concerns about potential supply risks helped offset the\nimpact of reduced demand from the 130,000 bpd Co-op refinery in\nRegina, Saskatchewan.The refinery, which runs on a mixture of heavy and synthetic\ncrude, is operating at about half capacity after an explosion\nrocked the facility last week.

The non-invasive nature of these tests, their accuracy \n      and safety have been the major reasons behind their popularity among \n      gynecologists and expecting mothers.MaterniT21 was the first NIPT launched in October 2011, by US based \n      Sequenom, Inc. and since then has been leading the market with the \n      largest market share. Harmony, verifi, Panorama, NIFTY, PrenaTest and \n      BambniTest are other commercially available NIPTs for detecting \n      chromosomal abnormalities.The exponential growth of the NIPT market is supported by factors such \n      as high incidence rate of babies born with Down syndrome, no risk of \n      miscarriage with NIPT and shifting trend towards child bearing at \n      advanced maternal age (35 years or older). As maternal age is closely \n      associated with the increasing risk of developing a fetus with \n      chromosomal abnormalities, rising maternal age is likely to contribute \n      to the increasing incidence of babies born with chromosomal aneuploidies.According to Down syndrome education (DSE), in the US, the incidence \n      rate for Down syndrome is 1 in every 830 child births (around 4,700 \n      annually), while in Europe the incidence rate is 1 in every 920 babies \n      born (around 9,000 annually), indicating a large potential consumer base \n      for NIPT.Conventional invasive prenatal genetic tests such as amniocentesis and \n      chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are associated with the chance of \n      miscarriage, which is the prime reason for their replacement with new \n      non-invasive prenatal tests. These new NIPTs are based on the analysis \n      of cell-free DNA floating in the maternal plasma and pose no risk of \n      miscarriage.Key Topics CoveredPrefaceExecutive SummaryGlobal Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing Market OverviewGlobal Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing Market Revenue, by Test, 2012 - \n        2019 (USD Million)Global Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing Market Revenue, by Geography, \n        2012 - 2019 (USD Million)Competitive LandscapeRecommendationsCompany ProfilesCompanies Mentioned- Ariosa Diagnostics- BGI Health- Berry Genomics- LifeCodexx- Natera- Sequenom- Verinata HealthFor more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/pmlnb7/noninvasiveAbout Research and MarketsResearch and Markets is the world's leading source for international \n      market research reports and market data.

The Colts allowed a staggering 82 points in road losses to Arizona and Cincinnati before sinking the Chiefs, part of a three-game run that has seen them outscore the opposition 78-20. Indianapolis has dominated the series, winning five of the last six.Unlike the Colts, Kansas City wobbled down the stretch, losing five of its last seven games after opening the season with nine straight wins and leading the league in points allowed. The Chiefs, seeking their first postseason victory since Joe Montana was under center in 1994, committed an uncharacteristic four turnovers in the loss to the Colts on Dec. 22. \"They've got the upper hand on us right now because in their minds they think they can beat us,\" Kansas City linebacker Derrick Johnson said after last month's loss.TV: 4:35 p.m. ET, NBC. LINE: Colts -2.5. O/U: 46.5ABOUT THE CHIEFS (11-5): There remains uncertainty whether leading wide receiver Dwayne Bowe will be cleared to play after suffering a concussion, but that won't alter the game plan for quarterback Alex Smith and Kansas City. The Chiefs will feature a heavy dose of running back Jamaal Charles, who led the AFC with 1,287 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns while hauling in a team-high 70 receptions and seven scoring passes. \"We called him public enemy No. 1,\" Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. \"If he doesn't touch the ball 30 times, I'd be shocked.\" After resting most of the starters in last week's loss at San Diego, the Chiefs are expecting the return of linebacker Justin Houston, who tied for the team sack lead (11) with Tamba Hali despite missing the last five games with a dislocated elbow.ABOUT THE COLTS (11-5): Indianapolis' offense went sideways when Luck lost his favorite target, Reggie Wayne, to a season-ending knee injury in Week 7. After a stretch of uneven performances, Luck has established a chemistry with young wideouts T.Y. Hilton, Griff Whalen and Da'Rick Rogers, throwing for eight touchdowns and one interception over the final four weeks. Hilton has emerged as a go-to receiver in his second season, hauling in 24 passes during the three-game win streak to finish with 82 on the season. Donald Brown has helped ease the sting of the trade for running back Trent Richardson by averaging 5.3 yards per carry and scoring six rushing TDs - two against the Chiefs. Robert Mathis, who had a league-high 19.5 sacks, heads a defense that yielded two TDs in the final three gamesEXTRA POINTS1. Smith had 11 TD passes versus one interception on the road as the Chiefs tied Miami (2008) and Indianapolis (2012) for the most wins by a team with two or fewer victories the previous season.2. Luck's 13 home wins in his first two seasons ties him with Atlanta's Matt Ryan for the second most in the Super Bowl era.3. Kansas City has averaged only 9.4 points in its last five losses to Indianapolis.PREDICTION: Colts 23, Chiefs 20"], "2014/01/04/hkn-jets-bruins-writethru-idUSMTZEA14W9HTRX20140104": ["Krug gets offensive, helps Bruins win", "2014/01/04", "Krug gets offensive, helps Bruins winBOSTON -- Rookie defenseman Torey Krug, never considered a serious contender for a spot on the United States Olympic hockey team, wasn't surprised when he didn't get the call.But Saturday, with Team USA director of player personnel Brian Burke watching from the press box, Krug put on an offensive show that might have made Burke and his associates wonder.Krug set up a first-period goal with a nifty pass and scored two in the second to lead Boston to a 4-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets in the Bruins' first game of the second half of the season.Afterward, sporting a couple of battle scars above his upper lip sustained from \"a stick to the face,\" that caused him to miss the last several minutes, Krug said he \"had no idea\" Burke was at the game.But when asked if it was cool that Burke was there, Krug smiled and said, \"Yeah, I guess.\"Krug's goals, his ninth and 10th but first in 12 games, tied him with Erik Karlsson of Ottawa and Shea Weber of Nashville for the league lead among defensemen.It was his second two-goal game and the three points were a career high.The two goals came after fellow defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, also passed over by Team USA, tied the game, 1-1, with Krug on the ice.\"That's frustrating, but it's all about putting it in the past and forgetting about it and making plays moving forward, and that's what we did tonight,\" Krug said.Krug made his debut in last season's playoffs, scoring four goals in five games against the New York Rangers in the first round, and is a plus-four in his first regular season.There have been some tough games lately, but not on Saturday.\"He's a great skater and he finds those lanes and he can shoot the puck,\" said goaltender Tuukka Rask, who made 36 saves as the Bruins improved to 28-12-2 with their 10th win in their last 11 home games.\"He also got a minus on that first goal, so I'm sure he wanted to get that back and he got it back big-time. I think he's been pretty solid. ... I think for the most part he's been a great threat offensively and defensively really good and improving all the time.\"Said coach Claude Julien, whose team heads to California for three tough games: \"He handled himself well. He played well. When he's on top of his game offensively, he makes things happen.\"Winger Daniel Paille scored his sixth goal of the season off Krug's pass, and right winger Reilly Smith capped the scoring with his team-high 15th goal midway through the third period.With Jordan Caron out because of a back injury, Julien, coaching his 500th game with Boston, placed new arrival Justin Florek on the left side of the line with veterans Paille and Gregory Campbell. That switched Paille from left wing to right.The new unit was sharp from the start, with Paille missing an early tip-in before running into goalie Ondrej Pavelec for a penalty.Krug then set up Paille for the first goal and Florek barely missed on a tip-in before Paille got the puck to Krug, who put the Bruins ahead 3:08 into the second period.At 7:18 of the period, Krug took a pass from fellow defenseman Adam McQauid, moved in and scored again, his shot deflecting in off Winnipeg defenseman Jason Trouba.Smith's goal put the game on ice.\"They know how to win,\" said Winnipeg right winger Chris Thorburn, who held his own in a first-period fight with giant Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara.\"They know how to do it in any kind of fashion, whether it's skill or mucking it up, and we knew that coming in. So we just didn't get to the front of the net. We didn't disturb Rask enough.\"NOTES: The teams engaged in three fights, two of them only two seconds apart early. ... Claude Julien became the third coach in Bruins' history to coach 500 games with the team.

Not with the way he played in the fourth quarter Saturday night.It didn't matter that Oklahoma City trailed Minnesota by 13 points with less than 11 minutes to play. It didn't matter that the Thunder struggled down the stretch in losses to Portland and Brooklyn. That's because Durant simply took over.Aggressive from behind the 3-point line and attacking the basket, Durant scored 23 of his season-high 48 points in the fourth quarter as the Thunder rallied for a come-from-behind, 115-111 victory over the Timberwolves.Early in the fourth quarter, Durant scored 16 of 17 points for the Thunder, single-handedly erasing Oklahoma City's deficit. At the end of the quarter, his step-back 18-footer with four seconds to play put the Thunder ahead for good, 113-111, and two free throws sealed the victory.\"Kevin was on fire,\" Thunder coach Scott Brooks said. \"He did a great job setting himself up to get open. Kevin took over when needed.\"The 48 points are the most scored by an NBA player this season while his 23-point outburst over the final 12 minutes is the best fourth quarter this season. Durant hit seven of 11 from the field in the fourth quarter and made four 3-pointers over the final 10 minutes.Not bad for a guy who said he was feeling down early in the game.\"I just stuck with it,\" Durant said. \"I was hanging my head a little bit in the first half and my teammates got on me about it. So I just wanted to keep my head high no matter what and stay aggressive and I was able to hit a few.\"Minnesota, who held Durant to a season low in the teams' first meeting this season, didn't double-team the NBA's leading scorer. Timberwolves wing Corey Brewer did a solid job on Durant for three quarters, but was the defender for much of the fourth-quarter explosion.\"The last two games we just didn't make shots,\" Durant said. \"But tonight when they played me straight up, I was able to get what I wanted to get and make some shots.\"Said Minnesota coach Rick Adelman: \"He's a great player. He makes shots from a lot of different angles and he puts a lot of pressure on you. When he gets going like that, he just pulls up from 30, 35 feet and knocks them down.\"Brooks has been around Durant long enough to know that these kind of outbursts can occur at any moment.\"I sense that every game,\" Brooks said. \"I feel he's going to be put in position to win games because he plays the right way and there's no agenda in his body. He plays to win each possession.\"Even with Durant's outburst, Minnesota still had a very good chance to win the game.Timberwolves power forward Kevin Love was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 2.2 seconds to play. Love missed the first two free throws and turned the ball over when his missed shot didn't hit the rim.\"Just missed them,\" said Love, who recorded his 29th double-double in 32 games this season with 30 points and 14 rebounds. \"I was more upset about the first one that I missed, left it short. I think they were flat and short and no real air on them. Just missed them.\"Center Nikola Pekovic led the Timberwolves with 31 points and 11 rebounds. Reserve point guard Derek Fisher scored 13 points for Oklahoma City while power forward Serge Ibaka had 12.Minnesota missed an opportunity to go above .500. The Timberwolves, who had won three of four, are now three games behind Dallas in the race for the eighth spot in the Western Conference.Thanks to Durant's outburst, the Thunder avoided losing three games in a row for the first time since last February. Oklahoma City is now tied with Portland for the best record in the Western Conference has also won eight consecutive road games.Durant admitted to being motivated by some people questioning whether the Thunderwolves can survive several weeks without point guard Russell Westbrook.\"I read a lot, and I hear a lot of what people say,\" Durant said. \"You interpret it how you want to. I just hear a lot of stuff and I just wanted to come through for my team in the fourth quarter.He certainly did that.NOTES: Oklahoma City was outscored 56-32 in the fourth quarter of losses this week to Portland and Brooklyn as the Thunder adjusts to playing without G Russell Westbrook. Both the Trail Blazers and the Nets made players other than F Kevin Durant beat them. \"They have other guys, but in the fourth quarter the last couple of games, for whatever reason it hasn't happened,\" Minnesota coach Rick Adelman said before the game. \"I think they'll figure it out; they're a quality team.\" ... Durant (28.6 points per game) and F Kevin Love (26.3 ppg) entered the game as the NBA's leading scorers. ... F Shabazz Muhammad, Minnesota's first-round draft pick, is headed to Des Moines and expected to play at least four games with the Iowa Energy of the NBA Development League. Muhammad has played little for the Timberwolves this season, appearing in only 11 games. ... The game was the first half of a back-to-back for Oklahoma City as the Thunder host Boston on Sunday night. Minnesota plays at Philadelphia on Monday and will attempt to complete the season sweep of the 76ers."]}

Samsung's new SmartCam HD and SmartCam HD Outdoor offer 1080p Full HD streaming and 128 degree ultra-wide angle lenses, giving consumers the ability to remotely monitor activity - both indoor and out - with full detail and clarity, via any computer or mobile device with no additional monthly video storage or monitoring fees.(Photo:http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140105/NY39723)\"Being able to remotely monitor activity outside the home or business simply and easily with great clarity is now possible for today's consumer,\" saidMike Palazzolo, vice president sales and marketing, consumer video monitoring and security products, Samsung Techwin America. \"With the SmartCam HD Outdoor, consumers who rely on WiFi IP cameras are no longer limited to use just within the home.\"Samsung's new SmartCam offerings provide consumers with the peace-of-mind knowing both the inside and outside of their home are secure, ensuring a safe environment for the entire family.The Samsung SmartCam HD was created with a sleek and stylish design allowing for placement anywhere in the home. The SmartCam HD is also wall-mountable for flexibility in placement and viewing.Designed to withstand the elements, the SmartCam HD Outdoor was engineered by Samsung with a dual-component design.\u00c2\u00a0 The weatherproof camera is placed outside while the power and Wi-Fi module stay inside. The camera and power/Wi-Fi component are connected with a simple network cable connection. This unique design allows the camera to have a small & discrete profile, eliminates the need to have an electrical outlet outside, and brings the Wi-Fi module inside within the range of a router, retaining a strong signal to the receiver.Advanced FeaturesThe SmartCam HD Outdoor and SmartCam HD Wi-Fi IP cameras bring advanced features and specifications to consumers, ensuring a vastly superior viewing experience. With a 2MP, 1/2.8-inch CMOS sensor and IR cut filter, the SmartCam HD and HD Outdoor offer superb detail no matter how dimly lit the environment may be. The 1/2.8\u00e2\u20ac\u2018inch CMOS sensor allows a large amount of light to be captured yielding more dynamic colors and details in the video compared to a smaller size sensor. The IR cut filter provides true day and night viewing to the user and both models come with a night vision mode, with the SmartCam HD providing a range of 16 feet and the HD Outdoor expanding on that to 50 feet.Available on both SmartCam HD models is local video recording. With local storage, video can record directly to the camera via a microSD slot, which can support a card up to 32GB. Depending on efficiency and viewing habits, recording can be set for continuous or based on motion events. The locally saved video can also be accessed and viewed remotely from a mobile device.Both SmartCam HD models can also be set up to automatically record video when motion or audio is detected. Users can select to have alerts of motion or audio detection sent in real time via email or push notifications to their mobile device. A truly valuable feature, this notification technology keeps safety and security paramount as it allows users to instantly respond to any unexpected events, such as a criminal break in, while providing stored video footage of events that can be reviewed and shared.Low Bandwidth UsageWhen using an IP camera, economy of bandwidth is very important. Other leading video cameras are always streaming video to a remote media server, which is necessary based on their infrastructure and business model.\u00c2\u00a0 Since video is always streaming, a tremendous amount of bandwidth from the homeowner's network is used and may slow down other devices, like computers, especially if more than one IP camera is installed.\u00c2\u00a0 The high bandwidth use may also raise concerns from the Internet Service Provider.With Samsung's highly efficient bandwidth utilization, and by applying advanced compression technology, the SmartCam HD's and HD Outdoor's video is streamed using only 30 percent of the network bandwidth of other IP cameras.\u00c2\u00a0 This highly efficient method of transmitting video combined with the fact that Samsung SmartCam HD cameras only transmit video and use bandwidth when an event occurs or the camera is being viewed from a mobile device, ensures much less strain on the network as well as seamless video transfer even when there is limited network bandwidth available.\u00c2Sets Up In MinutesThe SmartCam HD and HD Outdoor allow for simple setup using Wi-Fi Direct which can be accomplished on any an Android\u00c2\u00ae or iOS\u00c2\u00ae device in a matter of minutes.\u00c2\u00a0 Customers only need to download the free SmartCam app and follow the simple wizard\u00e2\u20ac\u2018like process.Other features on both models include two-way talk and motion zone selection.The Samsung SmartCam HD and HD Outdoor will be available inMarch 2014and retail for$179.00and$229.00, respectively.For additional information regarding Samsung Techwin America consumer video monitoring and security products, please visitwww.samsungsv.com.About Samsung Techwin AmericaSamsung Techwin is a leading supplier of advanced video surveillance solutions.

Housel did manage to find a trader on CNBC exhibiting symptoms of short-term thinking \u2014 but that\u2019s what CNBCdoes, and in fact it\u2019s possible to use CNBC\u2019s ratings as a reasonably good proxy for the general prevalence of short-term thinking. Guess what: they\u2019re attheir lowest point in 20 years, with the channel reaching just 38,000 viewers over the course of a day. That\u2019s a really tiny niche. Apotentially profitable niche, to be sure, but tiny all the same.Meanwhile, long-term thinking\u2019s true friends at Vanguard have never been healthier: the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is now the largest mutual fund in the world, havingovertakenthe Pimco Total Return Fund in October, and Vanguard\u2019s total assets under management are jaw-droppingly huge: theystarted last yearat $2 trillion, and were alreadyover $2.5 trillionby the end of June. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were at or near $3 trillion by now. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that substantially all of that money is being invested according to the tenets of long-term thinking \u2014 and that it vastly exceeds the amount of money being traded on a daily basis by the 38,000 viewers of CNBC. (They\u2019d need to have $80 millioneachto get to $3 trillion; and while CNBC viewers might be rich, they\u2019re notthatrich.)The height of short-term thinking, when it comes to investing, was surely the dot-com bubble, when everybody wanted to be a day trader, and everybody believed in the greater fool theory. When the dot-com bubble burst, individuals (outside a core group ofhobbyists) pretty much gave up on stock-picking and short-term trading. With hindsight, we can even say that the dot-com burst was very well timed to prepare America\u2019s investors for the financial crisis: once they had lived through 1999-2001, they grew up, and ended up responding to the crisis in a surprisingly mature and sensible manner.Here, for instance, is a chart of ETF flows during the crisis:What you\u2019re looking at here are some of the most torrid months that stock-market investors have ever seen. Just look at the monthly return figures on the S&P 500, from September 2008 through February 2009: -9.2%, -16.8%, -7.5%, +0.8%, -8.6%, -11.0%. Add it all up, and you get a stomach-churning 42% drop in the market \u2014 more than enough, according to conventional wisdom, to spark a major panic among retail investors. But what did they actually do? They ended up putting a net new $90 billionintoETFs over the course of those months.Or,here\u2019sa chart of mutual fund flows \u2014 a chart which naturally exaggerates outflows, since there\u2019s a long-term secular trend out of mutual funds and into ETFs. Again, there\u2019s no real sign of panic during the financial crisis: there was selling, to be sure, at a time when Americans found themselves in sudden need of liquidity, but you\u2019re not seeing any short-term thinking here: you\u2019re not seeing people trying to time the market. More generally, the main lesson of this chart is how small all the numbers are. Compared to the trillions invested in the stock market, weekly flows in the single-digit billions are pretty small beer, and show that nearly all investors, nearly all of the time, are doing the sensible buy-and-hold thing. When flows are small relative to stocks, that bespeaks long-term thinking, rather than short-term thinking.This is not the impression that you get from talking to professional financial advisers, of course, most of whom paint themselves as a desperately-needed bulwark protecting investors from their base instincts. And it\u2019s not the impression that you get from reading scaremongering stories about high-frequency trading, or misleading statistics from the likes of Housel, who says that the average stock holding period fell from eight years to five days between the 1960s and 2010. The problem with such numbers is that averages are little use to us here: a very small number of high-frequency algobots, who can hold their positions for less than a second, will skew the averages to the point of meaninglessness.Indeed, a big reason for the rise and rise of private markets, and the ever-increasing amount of time that companies wait before they go public, is precisely that there is an unprecedentedly large pool of long-term patient money out there, willing to tie itself up in private-equity and venture-capital funds for five or ten years or longer. Individuals are looking for investment advice not so much from the braying noisemakers on CNBC, but rather from institutions with quasi-permanent capital pools: endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds.Or, to put it another way, the war has pretty much been won at this point, and retail investors have got the message. They understand the superiority of passive investing, and they understand the importance of long-term thinking: none of these things, any more, are remotely difficult or counterintuitive concepts. Housel\u2019s column is in effect an attempt to persuade the sensible majority that they\u2019re some kind of beleaguered minority. In reality, however, long-term thinking is alive and well and utterly mainstream. Which should good news for everybody, with the possible exception of CNBC."]}

Officials report as many as 117 million people are living under dangerous wind chill warnings, advisories and watches.Sunday night 280 people stayed in 19 shelters inIndiana,Illinois,OhioandMassachusettsbecause of the weather. The Red Cross has helped people inIndiana,Illinois,Iowa,Wisconsin,Minnesota,Missouri,Nebraska,Kansas,North Dakota,South Dakota,New York,New Jersey,Connecticut,Rhode IslandandMassachusettssince the current winter onslaught began last week.PLEASE GIVE BLOODThe bitterly cold weather has already caused the cancellation of nearly 125 Red Cross blood drives in 17 states, resulting in almost 4,000 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Despite the weather, hospital patients across the country will still need blood. Please consider making an appointment to donate blood or platelets when it is safe to do so in your area.You can make an appointment to give blood online atredcrossblood.orgor by calling 1-800-RED CROSS. To give blood, someone must be at least 17 years of age, meet weight and height requirements and be in general good health.\u00c2\u00a0Donors should bring their Red Cross blood donor card or other form of positive ID with them. Some states allow 16-year-olds to give with parental consent.COLD WEATHER SAFETY TIPSAs this latest outbreak of cold air moves across the country, people could experience wind chills as cold as 60 degrees below zero in some areas. To stay safe during this dangerous weather, follow these steps:Wear layers of lightweight clothing to stay warm. Gloves and a hat will help prevent losing body heat.Someone should seek medical attention immediately if they have symptoms of hypothermia, including confusion, dizziness, exhaustion and severe shivering.Watch for symptoms of frostbite, including numbness, flushed gray, white, blue or yellow skin discoloration, numbness, or waxy feeling skin.Don't forget family pets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bring them indoors. If they can't come inside, make sure they have enough shelter to keep them warm and that they can get to unfrozen water.Avoid frozen pipes - run water, even at a trickle, to help prevent them from freezing. Open the kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. Keep the garage doors closed if there are water lines in the garage.Keep the thermostat at the same temperature day and night to help avoid freezing pipes.Download theRed Cross First Aid Appfor quick, expert advice on what to do in case of an emergency. This free app is available on theApple iTunesorGoogle Playstores.HOME FIRE RISK INCREASES DURING COLD\u00c2\u00a0Red Cross workers are also responding to numerous home fires across the country. During extremely cold weather, the risk for a fire in someone's home can increase. To avoid fire danger, you should remember the following:Never use a stove or oven to heat the home.If using a space heater, place it on a level, hard surface and keep anything flammable at least three feet away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c things such as paper, clothing, bedding, curtains or rugs. Turn off space heaters and make sure fireplace embers are out before leaving the room or going to bed.If using a fireplace, use a glass or metal fire screen large enough to catch sparks and rolling logs.Use generators correctly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c never operate a generator inside the home, including in the basement or garage.Don't hook a generator up to the home's wiring. The safest thing to do is to connect the equipment someone wants to power directly to the outlets on the generator.About the American Red Cross:The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families.

Final results from column leach tests for the oxide ore resources are 71% recovery for material that is crushed to 6mm and agglomerated with 1kg/t cement. Testwork on the sulphide and transition (semi-oxidized) resources indicate a recovery of 58% using a 12.5 mm crush size and agglomeration using 4kg/t of lime and 3kg/t of cement.\u00c2\u00a0The positive results indicate the potential of alternative lower cost mining methods.Oxide Column Test Results:A percolation column leach test was conducted on a composite sample of oxide ore resources with 92% passing 6mm to simulate heap leach cyanidation conditions.Gold recovery of 76% was achieved in 66 days, with >66% obtained in the first 30 days of leaching and >72% extraction in 40 days.Estimated sodium cyanide consumption was 0.2 kg/t and is considered moderate.Transition and Sulphide Column Test Results:54% recovery (79 to 92%) for the transition and sulphide material, with 100% passing 12mm.Gold recovery rates were moderate to fairly rapid, and gold recoveries of 79% for transition material and 55% for sulphide material were obtained in the first 10 days of leaching.\"With oxide and transition ore present at Buckreef project, these metallurgical results are encouraging and give us further confidence in the viability of the project at a lower cost than initially projected,\" said James Sinclair, President and CEO of Tanzanian Royalty Exploration. \"We envision an open pit heap leach operation, which could be very attractive at current gold prices.\"Mr. Sinclair went on to say that \"as a result of decreasing gold pricing, company management made the strategic decision to\u00c2\u00a0preserve shareholder funds by initiating a program to explore and test for all potential low cost mining methods on our mine targets and not be contractually bound to the most expensive means of final chemical processing for gold production. This will allow us to begin\u00c2\u00a0construction\u00c2\u00a0and mine\u00c2\u00a0production sooner then originally planned with significantly less engineering and capital investment using existing equipment.\"Although moving to a lower cost mining alternative and away from high priced, fixed contract engineering may result in an initial\u00c2\u00a0lower gold recovery percentage, the significantly lower engineering and\u00c2\u00a0development costs and faster lead time into production will\u00c2\u00a0result in improved payback and potential for self-financing the expansion into other mining projects.The Company is now working on developing the lower cost mine plan and its implementation as soon as possible.Sample Protocol and testwork proceduresMetallurgical composites have been prepared from the PQ core. A total of 3 composite samples have been created for oxide, transition and primary ore materials. Three representative sub-samples of each of the high grade and low grade drill core samples were split and crushed to 6mm, 12mm, 15mm and 20mm screen sizes. Simulated heap leach tests were undertaken on the 12 samples in order to ascertain the optimal crush size to use for column leach test work. This entailed bottle rolling each sample for 7 days in excess leach conditions.SGS Lakefield also commissioned a column heap leach test on each of the oxide, transition and primary samples. An amount of ~80 kg of each of the 6mm, 12mm, 15mm and 20mm screen sizes were sampled for the required testwork. The material was placed in a 190mm diameter column, simulating a heap height of 4.0m. A leach solution containing cyanide (NaCN) and lime (CaO) was then pumped into the column at a rate of 10lh/m2. After saturation of the column, approximately 4,200 ml of pregnant solution was collected from the columns every 24 hours and analyzed for gold, NaCN and CaO concentrations for a period of 60 days.After leaching, the ore beds were washed with water for 4 days at the same rate as the leach solution and then allowed to drain. A profile analysis of the solids contained in the columns was then carried out (top, middle and bottom). This was followed by 48 hour batch dissolution tests on the profile sub-samples of the heap leach column tails, which were subjected to milling to a target grind of 80% passing 75 micron.Qualified PersonThe work described above was undertaken under the guidance of Tracey Stanek, Manager for the Metallurgy and Mineralogy Division at SGS South Africa (Pty) Limited in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Air raids\nwould flush them out, he told Reuters.\"The air force will end this battle in the next few hours,\"\nsaid Falih al-Essawi, a member of the council running Anbar\nprovince, adding that government workers and students in Ramadi\nhad been told to return to work and school on Tuesday.Two local tribal leaders in Falluja said meetings were being\nheld with clerics and community leaders to find a way to\npersuade fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n(ISIL) to leave Falluja and avert further violence.Iraqi forces have shelled and launched multiple airstrikes\nagainst militants over the past week, whilst armed Sunni\ntribesmen from the area are fighting on both sides. Officials\nsay dozens of militants have been killed, but the number of\ncasualties among civilians, security forces and tribal fighters\nis not yet clear.Maliki ordered the army, which is currently surrounding\nFalluja, not to attack residential areas as his forces prepare\nan offensive that has echoes of U.S. assaults in 2004 on the\ncity, some 40 km (25 miles) west of Baghdad's main airport.Security officials said Maliki, who is also commander in\nchief of the armed forces, had agreed to hold off an assault for\nnow at least to give tribal leaders in Falluja more time to\ndrive out the Sunni Islamist militants on their own.\"No specific deadline was determined, but it will not be\nopen-ended,\" a special forces officer said of plans to attack.\"We are not prepared to wait too long. We're talking about a\nmatter of days only. More time means more strength for\nterrorists\".ISIL has emerged in Syria's civil war as an affiliate of the\ninternational al Qaeda network and a powerful force among Sunni\nMuslim rebels seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad.In Iraq, it has been tightening its grip on Anbar province,\na thinly populated region the size of Greece, with the stated\naim of creating a Sunni state straddling the border into Syria's\nrebel-held eastern desert provinces.But last week's capture of positions in Ramadi and large\nparts of Falluja was the first time in years that Sunni\ninsurgents had taken ground in the province's main towns strung\nalong the Euphrates river, and held their positions for days.The White House said on Monday it would speed up deliveries\nof equipment to help Iraq battle the militants, including\nadditional shipments of Hellfire missiles as early as this\nspring, 10 ScanEagle surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles in\ncoming weeks and 48 Raven surveillance UAVs later this year.The United States said on Sunday it would help Maliki fight\nal Qaeda, but would not send troops to Iraq. An\nIranian official offered similar help.\"CITY OF MOSQUES\"When Iraqi police broke up a Sunni protest last week in\nRamadi, the capital of Anbar, deadly clashes fanned tensions\nacross the province that was the heart of the insurgency after\nthe 2003 U.S. invasion that brought Shi'ite majority rule.The tribes of Anbar helped turn the tide of that insurgency\nat its height in 2006, banding together and making common cause\nwith U.S. troops to rout al Qaeda.The group's resurgence has divided people in Anbar, where\nmany accuse Maliki of shutting Sunnis out of power and being a\npawn of Shi'ite Iran. Some sympathise with and support the\nIslamist militants, or are too fearful to move against them.Others have vowed to help the government regain control.\"We are going to have an important meeting this evening and\nthat will include some al Qaeda fighters in Falluja to convince\nthem to leave the city and deprive Maliki of a pretext to push\nhis army inside the city,\" said one tribal leader.\"We should make al Qaeda fighters understand that their\nstaying in Falluja will create rivers of blood.\"Known as the \"City of Mosques\" and a focus for Sunni faith\nand identity in Iraq, Falluja is home to some 300,000 people and\nwas badly damaged in two offensives by U.S. forces against\ninsurgents in 2004.In recent days, residents have been fleeing the town in\ndroves to escape fighting as well as shortages of food, drinking\nwater, and frequent power cuts.\"The situation in Falluja is getting worse. There are gunmen\neverywhere,\" said doctor Mohammed al-Nuaimi, a resident of the\ncity who spoke to Reuters via telephone as he packed his\nbelongings and prepared to leave.\"We can't tell who's a friend and who's an enemy. I lost my\nelder brother in 2005 - he was killed by the Americans - and now\nI see same scenario happening. I'm not ready to feel the pain\nagain.\"The militants have also received help in Falluja from\ndisgruntled tribesmen who have joined forces with them.Much of Iraq's U.S.-equipped army is drawn from the Shi'ite\nmajority and faces recalcitrance if not outright hostility in\nAnbar, which covers about a third of the country's territory.Across the border, al Qaeda fighters have also captured\nswathes of Syria and are battling with fellow Islamist brigades\nas well as government forces.Two years after U.S. troops ended a near-decade long\noccupation, violence in Iraq underlines how civil war between\nSyrian rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and other Sunni powers on\none side and Assad, an ally of Shi'ite Iran, on the other has\ninflamed a broader confrontation along sectarian lines.\n\n (Additional reporting by Suadad al-Salhy in Baghdad, Roberta\nRampton andSteve Hollandin Washington, writing by Isabel\nColes; editing byAlastair Macdonald, Philippa Fletcher and\nCynthia Osterman)"], "2014/01/06/us-saturdaynightlive-idUSBREA0514420140106": ["'Saturday Night Live' adds black female comedian Zamata to cast", "2014/01/06", "LOS ANGELES(Reuters) - \"Saturday Night Live\" has hired comedian Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member for the late-night comedy sketch show, a spokeswoman for network NBC said on Monday, months after the program was criticized for a lack of diversity among its female cast.Zamata, who stars in her own internet comedy series \"Pursuit of Sexiness,\" will be the first African-American female cast member since Maya Rudolph left \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2007.\"SNL\" came under criticism in October for its lack of female diversity after cast member Kenan Thompson said he would no longer play black women such as Whoopi Goldberg and Maya Angelou.The show later spoofed that criticism with a sketch in which guest host Kerry Washington played several African-American figures, including first lady Michelle Obama, whose character has been left out of much of the show's political satire because of casting.Zamata, who has performed with the Upright Citizens Brigade improv comedy troupe, will make her debut on January 18.\"Saturday Night Live,\" which has launched the Hollywood careers of Chevy Chase, Mike Myers, Tina Fey and others, added six new members to its cast in September before the beginning of its current 39th season.NBC is owned by Comcast Corp.(Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing byPiya Sinha-RoyandJonathan Oatis)"], "2014/01/06/britain-osborne-cuts-idUSL6N0KG0JP20140106": ["UK needs 25 bln stg of spending cuts after 2015 vote, Osborne says", "2014/01/06", "LONDONJan 6 (Reuters) - Britain needs to cut 25 billion\npounds ($41 billion) in spending after next year's election to\nreduce borrowing, finance minister George Osborne said on\nMonday.Osborne will stress in a speech later on Monday that the job\nof reducing Britain's budget deficit is far from done.\"We need to find a further 25 billion pounds of cuts after\nthe election.

Increased domestic competition is prompting an expected 36 \n        percent growth for cost estimators. Global competition requires \n        better-trained managers to improve efficiencies and manage projects. \n        (Check out the nextTechnical \n        Management Programin March).Paralegal:BLS estimates the growth rate from 2010-2020 at 18 \n        percent, or 46,900 added jobs.

The system allows bridging into \n        a network via existing protocols which lowers the cost of entry for \n        the consumer as they can use existing music sources in the homeConsumer experience:The VibeHub takes advantage \n        of CSRaptX\u00c2\u00aecoding technologies for high-quality audio over a Bluetooth connection \n        and a higher bitrate version with forward error correction (FEC) for \n        IP networks. This high quality IP network variant is supported by \n        SyncLock technology, which has been developed for broadcast Audio Over \n        IP applications. SyncLock distributes audio over the network and \n        enables tight synchronization between speakers, meaning there is no \n        noticeable time-lapse experienced by listeners in different rooms. The \n        system can also support multi-user scenarios, giving users the option \n        to listen to different music in different rooms, from a variety of \n        different sourcesIntuitive system control:CSR has developed \n        Android and iOS apps to control the system which can be easily \n        reskinned by end brands to fit with their look and feel.

Among other things, Justice Ginsburg said that if Congress had wanted to tinker with the Supreme Court\u2019s 1988 precedent on securities class certification,Basic v. Levinson, it could have done so in 1995, when lawmakers passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, or again in 1998, when the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act became law. Instead, Justice Ginsburg wrote in Amgen, \u201cCongress rejected calls to undo the fraud\u007f-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed in Basic.\u201dBut is that really what Congress did in 1995? The answer to that question could have a big impact on the future of securities class actions.The Amgen case, as you know, led directly to this term\u2019s securities blockbuster:Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund, which puts Basic\u2019s presumption of shareholder reliance on supposed corporate misstatements \u2013 and thus the foundation of most securities fraud class actions \u2013 directly before the justices. Halliburton\u2019s lawyers atBaker Bottsfiled theirmerits brieflast week, urging the court to undo Basic as bad law based on misguided economic theory. On Monday, Halliburton\u2019s amici joined in. They\u2019re mostly the usual suspects: theU.S. Chamber of Commerce and other pro-business organizations; theSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association; theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants; the Washington Legal Foundation; and DRI \u2013 The Voice of the Defense Bar. Two different groups of law professors filed briefs, one atechnical argument about the efficient-market theoryunderlying Basic and the other ascholarly condemnationof securities class action litigation.I was particularly intrigued, though, bya briefthat purports to support neither side, filed by five former Republican members of Congress and seven former Congressional and Securities and Exchange Commission staffers, all of whom were involved in the passage of securities litigation reform in 1995. (The SEC staffers served under Democrat-appointed SEC chairman Arthur Levitt.) According to this brief, Justice Ginsburg wasn\u2019t quite right when she concluded in Amgen that Congress rejected calls to do away with Basic. The 1995 law passed by both houses, overriding a veto by President Clinton, didn\u2019t actually end up addressing the fraud-on-the-market theory of classwide investor reliance at all \u2013 which, according to the brief, should not be construed by the Supreme Court as a rejection of efforts to repudiate the precedent.\u201cCongress did not answer any of the competing calls to overturn, modify, or codify the Basic presumption,\u201dSullivan & Cromwellargued for the amici. \u201cCongress was simply silent in response to those various requests, and this court should not take Congress\u2019s silence as implicit acceptance or rejection of Basic\u2019s fraud-on-the-market theory.\u201dThe brief, which is signed by former New York Senator Alphonse D\u2019Amato and former Virginia Congressman Thomas Bliley, among others, exhaustively recounts the legislative history of the securities litigation reform law, which began with a House bill that did attempt to undo Basic, included House and Senate hearings on the presumption of reliance and proposals to involve the SEC in the determination of market efficiency, and ended with a law that squeaked past Clinton\u2019s veto. The final version, a compromise designed to attract bipartisan support, skirted several points of controversy, including not only the presumption of investor reliance but also the standard of proof for intent to defraud. \u201cIt was not possible in that situation for Congress to speak to any and all issues related to private securities-fraud litigation,\u201d the brief asserted. In such political circumstances, the former lawmakers and staffers argued, the justices should not infer that Congress endorsed Basic\u2019s reasoning.That\u2019s especially true, they contended, because the Exchange Act of 1934 does not explicitly grant private investors a right to sue for securities fraud at all. As the Supreme Court discussed in its Basic decision, federal judges inferred that private cause of action in the statute, in a backdoor sort of lawmaking that is disdained by the current Supreme Court. \u201cThis court has repeatedly cautioned against relying on legislative inaction as evidence of acquiescence,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThat caution is especially warranted here\u2026. Whatever the court\u2019s normal reluctance to infer acquiescence from legislative inaction, it should be especially loath to assume that Congress implicitly ratified a judicially-created evidentiary presumption.\u201dIf the Supreme Court wants to look at legislative history, it should consider instead the record of the passage of the Exchange Act itself, according to the briefs of both Halliburton and the law professors represented byWachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katzand Stanford\u2019sJoseph Grundfest. In the provision of the 1934 law that specifically addresses the rights of private investors, Section 18, Congress insisted that shareholders show they relied on purported misstatements. (That reliance requirement is why investors almost never sue under Section 18 but instead assert classwide claims under Section 10b5.) \u201cThe 1934 Act\u2019s legislative history leaves no doubt that, had the Seventy-Third Congress addressed the question, it would not have created a private Section 10(b) right unless that right required proof of actual reliance,\u201d the law profs\u2019 brief said. \u201cThat history further underscores that Congress would not have condoned a presumption of reliance.\u201dThis issue of congressional endorsement is much more than an opportunity for nostalgia for a few superannuated lawmakers. Remember, the majority\u2019s decision in Amgen rested in part on the idea that Congress had implicitly accepted Basic\u2019s premise of investor reliance. If Halliburton and its amici can knock out that premise, shareholders will lose one of their best arguments for leaving Basic precedent alone.By joining the majority in the Amgen decision, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito demonstrated the Supreme Court\u2019s institutional squeamishness about overturning rulings by their predecessors. That\u2019s why Halliburton and several of its amici take pains to argue why the Basic decision is not entitled to the Supreme Court\u2019s typical deference to its own precedent. Those arguments will be easier for Roberts and Alito to swallow if Basic doesn\u2019t also have Congress\u2019s backing.For more of my posts, please go to\u00c2WestlawNext Practitioner InsightsFollow me on Twitter"], "2014/01/08/us-autos-ford-ceo-idUSBREA061AJ20140108": ["Microsoft close to naming CEO, Ford's Mulally stays put", "2014/01/08", "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is closer to naming a new chief executive, according to a source familiar with the board's thinking, but it lost a front-runner candidate on Tuesday when Ford Motor Co's (F.N) chief, Alan Mulally, said he would not be going to the software giant.Mulally's comments reignited the guessing game over who will take over at Microsoft, following the elimination in December of another reported candidate, Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) Steve Mollenkopf.Microsoft said last month it expects to appoint a new CEO early this year. It has been seeking a replacement for Steve Ballmer since the long-time CEO in August announced his plan to retire.Sources familiar with the process have told Reuters that Microsoft is down to a \"handful\" of candidates, including one or more outsiders from the tech industry, former Nokia (NOK1V.HE) CEO Stephen Elop and insiders Satya Nadella and Tony Bates.Mulally, who has never denied his interest in the Microsoft job, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he will remain at Ford at least this year. Two people close to the matter told Reuters that Mulally is no longer under consideration for the top job at Microsoft.\"Out of respect for the process and the potential candidates, we don't comment on individual names,\" a Microsoft spokesman said.The Ford CEO said he wanted to end the Microsoft speculation \"because I have no other plans to do anything other than serve Ford.\" When the AP asked whether his comments should end concerns from investors about his exit, Mulally said: \"You don't have to worry about me leaving.\"Ford spokesman Jay Cooney confirmed the comments. After news of the interview, Ford shares rose 1.3 percent in extended trade, while Microsoft shares fell 1.1 percent.Several prominent Microsoft investors had campaigned behind the scenes for Mulally to succeed Ballmer. But one source familiar with Microsoft's board's discussions said Mulally's candidacy raised questions about \"culture and leadership style\".Mulally's apparent interest in the job attracted considerable media attention that overshadowed Ford's product-related announcements, such as the roll-out of the new Mustang, something that frustrated Ford's board of directors, people familiar with the matter said.(Reporting byDeepa SeetharamanandBernie Woodallin Detroit,Nadia Damouniin New York andBill Rigbyin Seattle; Editing by Dan Grebler, Leslie Adler andKen Wills)"], "2014/01/07/ca-mrv-communications-idUSnBw075391a+100+BSW20140107": [0, "2014/01/07", "MRV to Present at the 16thAnnual Needham & \n      Company Growth ConferenceMRV Communications (OTC: MRVC), a global leader in converged packet and \n      optical solutions thatempower \n      the optical edge and network integration services for leading \n      communications service providers, will participate in the 16thAnnual Needham & Company Growth Conference to be held January 14ththrough 16that the New York Palace Hotel in New York City.CEO David Stehlin is scheduled to present on Tuesday, January 14th at \n      3:30 p.m. Eastern time.

More impressively, it is also an open platform that third-party applications can exploit to create novel experiences for users, applying personal, physical and geographical opt-in data.The Razer Nabu has three core features:1.\u00c2Notifications on Your WristThe Razer Nabu has two OLED notification screens -- a Public Icon Screen and a Private Message Screen. ThePublic icon screen-- located on the top of the wrist -- notifies users of incoming calls, texts, emails and app updates via notification icons.

An included utility app can customize the type of data collected and can set permissions for the data to be shared.3.\u00c2The First Truly Social WearableThe Razer Nabu's band-to-band communication abilities allows for social discovery. Find nearby friends, mutual acquaintances and more based on user-defined settings.The collected data as well as pre-configured capabilities and gestures on the Razer Nabu will be available on an open development platform to allow first- and third-party developers to update existing apps or build new ones to create new types of personal and social experiences for Razer Nabu wearers and third-party app users.\"Smart watches in their current form are too bulky and fitness trackers are easily forgotten after the initial novelty wears off -- we have fixed all of that,\" notes Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder, CEO and creative director. \"The Razer Nabu provides a revolutionary new platform that bridges the divide between so-called smart watches and fitness bands. It delivers only the information you need, collects data that you want, and deepens your social interactions. Most excitingly, with our open platform, developers can utilize data collected by the Nabu to deliver incredible experiences to individuals via mobile or desktop apps -- social or otherwise.\"The Razer Nabu comes with a downloadable utility app available on both iOS and Android devices -- a one-stop destination for band settings, profile ID, notifications received, opt-in data, app synchronization and more.The Razer Nabu will be available for sale worldwide in late Q1 2014 (retail price, TBD), while developers can sign-up now and get the band at the developer's price of $49.For more information on the Razer Nabu, interested parties may visitwww.razerzone.com/nabu, and the product launch video is available here:http://youtu.be/s2Fp8XqKWfMABOUT THE RAZER NABU SMART BAND:Availability:Worldwide launch at the end of Q1.Price:Developer's price, $49; retail price, TBD.Displays and sensors:Public icon screen: 32x32 pixel OLEDPrivate message screen: 128x32 pixel OLEDAccelerometerAltimeterCylindrical vibration motorSoftware:Works with iOS + AndroidDownloadable Nabu Utility app for notifications, data, and other settingsPower and battery:Lithium-polymer battery7 days between chargesUSB charging cable includedWater resistance and operational requirements:Rain and splashproofOperating temp: - 20\u00c2\u00b0C to 45\u00c2\u00b0C/ -4\u00c2\u00b0F to 113\u00c2\u00b0FImages:Black backgroundWhite backgroundTransparent backgroundAbout Razer:Razer\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is the world leader in devices and software platforms that enable, connect and entertain a worldwide community of electronic entertainment enthusiasts, 24/7.With a rich history in gaming, music and design, Razer's award-winning technology includes voice-over IP and other social applications and devices; programs for music production, performance and enjoyment; cloud-based solutions for customizing and enhancing computer systems and related product performance; and a wide array of award-winning laptops, tablets, audio products, hardware and accessories, and apparel.Razer applies its design and engineering resources to develop products that support the on-the-go lifestyle inherent to its contemporary, global, technophile community, fulfilling their immediate wants and needs wherever they are.

October's trade shortfall was revised down to\n$39.3 billion from a previously reported $40.6 billion.The bigger-than-expected decline - economists polled by\nReuters forecast November's trade deficit would slip to $40.0\nbillion - could spur higher fourth-quarter growth estimates.In Europe, an unexpected fall in German unemployment last\nmonth on a seasonally adjusted basis was the first drop since\nJuly. The decline bolstered hopes domestic consumption could\nboost growth in Europe's biggest economy.Investors also welcomed a successful Irish debt sale, the\ngovernment's first since the country exited an international\nbailout in December, as an indication Europe's battered\nperiphery was on the road to recovery.

The Cloud Elements Documents Hub is a developer tool providing a single API to integrate Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Sky Drive, and Microsoft SharePoint, all through a uniform set of REST application programming interface (API) calls. With Cloud Elements' innovative 'one-to-many' approach to integrations, developers can connect to an entire category of services (e.g., Documents, CRM, Service, Marketing, Accounting) in a fraction of the time and cost of alternative integration approaches.The Cloud Elements Documents Hub provides a single console to provision, integrate, monitor and maintain these services. Their integrated platform delivers, for the first-time, seamless interaction between all of the leading document storage providers. With Cloud Elements' Documents Hub, software developers now have the quickest and most cost-effective way to add these documents and file storage services into their SaaS applications. Additional document and file services will regularly be added to the Documents Hub, including support early next year for Amazon S3 and Rackspace Files.SaaS application developers face a daunting challenge keeping up with the rapidly expanding universe of cloud services that their applications need to co-exist with. Their clients have important documents and files stored in any number of cloud storage services, each accessed with a unique set of user credentials. To date, developers of these SaaS applications have had to write a custom, one-off integration to each document service, wasting hundreds of hours of development time to integrate them all. Now with Cloud Elements, developers write to one API and the Documents Hub connects their application to a growing list of cloud services including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Sky Drive, and Microsoft SharePoint. The Cloud Elements Documents Hub allows developers to easily provision and integrate services within their specific environments. The Cloud Elements singular dashboard offers automated monitoring and innovative tagging for granular account tracking and seamless interoperability between services (e.g., attach, store, and send documents and files).\"Cloud Elements' mission is to make it easier for developers to integrate, monitor and maintain the cloud services their applications depend on,\" said Mark Geene, CEO, Cloud Elements. \"By partnering with Cloud Elements, for the first time developers don't have to choose which service to integrate, but instead they can have all of the leading services integrated into their app for less time than it takes to integrate just one service. Get Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Sky Drive, Microsoft SharePoint and more for a fraction of the time and a fraction of the code.\"Slidefish, a Sydney, Australia-based documents sharing, feedback and analytics tool, has integrated the Cloud Elements Documents Hub. Slidefish CEO Neil Smith says, \"The Cloud Elements Documents 'Elements' take a huge amount of pain away from us. Not having to worry about ongoing API changes from the various cloud document storage providers means that we can integrate with their services much faster, on a larger scale and more reliably than we could on our own.\"Marc Haverland, CTO ofTrackVia, an application building platform for business users, says, \"Using Cloud Elements' 'one-to-many' approach is allowing us to integrate to all of the leading cloud document services in less time than it would have taken us to integrate to just one service.\"The Cloud Elements Documents Hub is free for developers to integrate into their applications and use in support of up to five customers. Developers can access the service using their GitHub account. Subscription plans begin at $99 per month.About Cloud Elements:Cloud Elementsis a cloud-to-cloud integration service that developers use to integrate, monitor and maintain leading cloud services at a fraction of the cost and time.\u00c2\u00a0With their unique one-to-many approach, a developer can integrate a single API to access all the leading services in categories such asdocuments,messaging,payments,CRM,Customer Service,Social Networkingand more.

That is good news for Germany and the United States,\nwhich have handily beat that benchmark, but not quite so cheery\ntidings for the other 12 major economies which, six years or so\nin, are still waiting.One obvious lesson, that it is good to be Germany or the\nU.S. with their better credit and superior financial\nflexibility, is true but of far less general use.That may well be because the U.S. and Germany have helped to\ndictate tactics which emphasize softer, easier responses like\nmild austerity and loan forbearance, while steering the global\ndebate away from tougher options. That is politically easier -\nit is far more opaque to allow growth to winnow away debt than\nto tax savings outright, or, heaven forfend, actually allow\ninsolvent entities to default.\u201cThe claim is that advanced countries do not need to resort\nto the standard toolkit of emerging markets, including debt\nrestructurings and conversions, higher inflation, capital\ncontrols and other forms of financial repression,\u201d Reinhart and\nRogoff write in a paper authored for the International Monetary\nFund. (here)\u201cAs we document, this claim is at odds with the historical\ntrack record of most advanced economies, where debt\nrestructuring or conversions, financial repression, and a\ntolerance for higher inflation, or a combination of these were\nan integral part of the resolution of significant past debt\noverhangs.\u201dWORSE THAN THE 30S?To be clear: the authors are suggesting that we may end up\nwith a crisis worse than the depression of the 1930s because we\nare unwilling to turn to the tools which have consistently\nproven needed and useful in similar earlier busts.Those tools, of course, are not pretty.Unlike \u201cforbearance\u201d in which a debtor is allowed to muddle\nalong without fully discharging its obligations, a default is a\nsharp and painful event. It crystallizes the loss for the\nlender, who must then recognize it and adjust capital\naccordingly. It is also vastly psychologically more painful for\neveryone involved.Financial repression too is less fun than a trip to the\ndentist. It involves, in essence, taking people\u2019s money away\nfrom them, by forcing their pension funds to invest in ways\nwhich the state wants, or by achieving a tax on savings in other\nways.Perhaps worst of all is high inflation, a genie ever\nresistant to being put back in its bottle, and one which is\nextremely capricious about whose wishes it grants and whose it\ndashes.And yet, as Reinhart and Rogoff demonstrate, these are all\ntactics which are employed, by great nations and small, time and\nagain in the aftermath of large busts.First World War debt owed the U.S. by a host of nations was\nwritten off in 1934, giving France a break on loans equal to\nnearly a quarter of its GDP and Italy a break on debts amounting\nto 19 percent of output. Don\u2019t forget that this happened a year\nafter the U.S. went off the gold standard, essentially helping\nitself to a debt writedown of 16 percent of a much larger GDP.Now of course, things may be very much different this time.The debts however are not, at least in scale.Indeed debt in advanced economies is approaching a\ntwo-century high. When compared to gross domestic product,\ngovernment debt is now almost as high as it was during the\n1940s, when countries borrowed heavily to fund a world war.

The brothers\nlater moved into Hong Kong - making and distributing films to a\nchain of around 100 cinemas spread across other Asian markets\nsuch as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.Shaw eventually split from his brothers to set up his own\nstudio in the 1950s dubbed the dream factory, which ushered in a\ngolden era of Hong Kong film-making.Shaw is also remembered as a philanthropist, especially\nfondly in mainland China, where he donated 4.5 billion yuan\n($744 million) over the years, mostly to education, according to\nHong Kong media reports. Many school buildings in the mainland\nare named after him.Chinese Internet users paid tribute to Shaw on Tuesday,\nsaying wealthy Chinese should follow his example.\"People say the Chinese hate rich people, but why do so many\nChinese mourn Run Run Shaw?\" wrote one user of Sina Weibo,\nChina's Twitter-like microblog site. \"It's because his name is\non school buildings everywhere, compared to so many Chinese\nmoguls who splurge on yachts, limousines and weddings.\"KUNG FU CLASSICSThe Shaw studio produced about a thousand titles, including\nmelodramas, historical epics and kung fu classics like \"The\nOne-armed Swordsman\" - helping to redefine genres and lure new\ncinema-goers not only in Hong Kong and Asia, but in the West.Shaw also invested in a number of co-productions, most\nnotably the Ridley Scott classic, \"Blade Runner\", starring\nHarrison Ford, in 1982.The studio also pioneered so-called \"Wu Xia\" or sword-play\ngenre films - which had frenetic fight scenes with mixed\nweapons.Ang Lee's Oscar-winning \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" is\na striking modern example of the genre. The Shaw influence is\nalso evident in the films of kung fu legend Bruce Lee, Jackie\nChan and director John Woo.While Shaw was famed for his business acumen and nose for\nspotting and grooming new talent, he famously turned away a\nbrash, young actor who came to see him in the 1960s.That spurned man was Bruce Lee, who later teamed up with\nRaymond Chow, a former Shaw deputy-turned-rival, to make \"The\nBig Boss\" in 1971, propelling him to stardom.In 1980, Shaw focused on television, becoming the chairman\nof TVB, which grew into a successful television and\nentertainment empire that remains a deep influence on popular\nculture in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese communities.In 2011, Shaw sold his entire 26 percent stake in TVB to a\nconsortium for HK$6.26 billion ($807 million). He retired as\nchairman at the end of that year after holding the post for 30\nyears and was appointed chairman emeritus.The tycoon also ran the so-called Shaw prizes, sometimes\nreferred to as Asia's answer to the Nobel prizes, which rewards\nexcellence in maths, astronomy and science, with a monetary\nprize of $1 million for each laureate.He was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1977 and\nreceived the Grand Bauhinia Medal from the Hong Kong government\nin 1998.Popularly known as \"Luk Suk\" or \"Sixth Uncle\", Shaw was born\nin 1907, the sixth child of a well-to-do family in the eastern\nChinese city of Ningbo.Shaw married twice. His first wife died in 1987. He is\nsurvived by his current wife, Mona Fong, two sons and two\ndaughters.\n($1 = HK$7.75)\n\n (Additional reporting byJames Pomfret, and Li Hui in BEIJING;\nEditing by Anne Marie Roantree and Nick Macfie)"], "2014/01/07/ma-analog-devices-idUSnBw075027a+100+BSW20140107": [0, "2014/01/07", "Crosspoint Transceivers Distribute Wide Range of \n      Ultra-High-Definition Home and Professional Audio/Video ContentAnalog \n      Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ: ADI) introduced today a family of three \n      high-performanceHDMI \n      crosspoint transceiversthat distributehigh-definition \n      audio and videocontent across a range of professional and home A/V \n      systems.

For the first time ever, customers can use a SaaS platform to run advertising campaigns seamlessly on their own premium direct publishers with a new MRAID 2.0-supported Ad Server as well as via RTB. The updated MAMP platform also adds Dynamic Visual Reports and RTB integration with all of the major ad exchanges.\"The fact our MAMP has an Ad Server, a RTB Bidder and a Decision Engine under one roof is truly unique. Normally, Ad Servers don't come with a Decision Engine and rely on manual optimization. Our MAMP allows users to choose which targeting criteria they want to set manually, and which they want to allow the Decision Engine to optimize for them,\" said Roi Chobadi, co-founder and chief product officer, LiquidM. \"Our platform is the first full-stack SaaS to save mobile advertisers the hassle of using several independent point solutions -- whether it's an Ad Server for direct publishers or DSP for RTB. Put simply, our MAMP removes the typical manual labor required across the ad management lifecycle. It's what our customers asked for. And it's what the market demanded.\"Unlike point solutions such as a performance-only DSP, LiquidM's MAMP spans the entire spectrum from direct publishers (Ad Serving / SDK) to RTB supply -- and its advanced technology covers the entire mobile ad value chain in premium and performance environments.MAMP New FeaturesAd Server and SDK- Combined with direct publisher ad serving, LiquidM's new proprietary SDK offers full support of any ad type and size (e.g., banner, interstitials, interactive) as well as Mobile Rich Media Ad Interface Definitions (MRAID) 2.0 support, ensuring a standardized set of commands designed to work with HTML5 and JavaScript.\u00c2Dynamic Visual Reports- Eliminates the need of ad operators to spend time working with Excel, allowing users to maneuver information to generate beautiful, customized ad campaign reports within the same platform campaigns are created.RTB Bidder- Includes integrations with all the major RTB ad exchanges, enabling customers to run campaigns on either their own direct publishers or large volumes of RTB traffic. LiquidM's platform uniquely allows users to set campaigns to run seamlessly on both their own publishers, and then use RTB Bidder's reach extension as necessary to make sure a campaign is fully delivered.Decision Engine- LiquidM's new version of Decision Engine leverages state of the art machine learning algorithms to offer ROI optimization for either RTB traffic or direct publishers. Users can choose the exact amount of manual optimization they want to do from fully manual to fully automatic, eliminating the reliance on manual optimization even for campaigns running on direct publishers.\"We draw on decades of experience in enterprise software and our fresh approach is really resonating with ad tech customers. We've seen how SaaS revolutionized the enterprise, and we believe it will do the same to mobile ad tech,\" said Christof Wittig, co-founder and CEO, LiquidM. \"I'm glad to see our team's unique background bring such a disruptive product to market.

The Bulls are 2-1 thus far on a four-game homestand after knocking off Atlanta 91-84 on Saturday, the club's fifth win in seven games following a 9-16 start and the third straight game in which Chicago has held an opponent to 85 points or fewer. Mike Dunleavy continued a solid personal run with 20 points off the bench and three starters finished with double-doubles.Chicago moved forward Luol Deng to Cleveland late Monday night in exchange for center Andrew Bynum - who the Bulls are expected to waive on Tuesday - and three draft picks. Chicago's solid defense is an interesting matchup for a Suns squad that ranks among the league leaders in scoring and is second in 3-pointers per game at 9.7. Phoenix will be opening a five-game road trip after defeating Milwaukee 116-100 at home on Saturday. That rout came in the Suns' second straight game without point guard Eric Bledsoe, who ranks second on the team in scoring and assists but is sidelined a few more games with a knee injury.TV: 8 p.m. ET, FSN Arizona (Phoenix), WGN (Chicago)ABOUT THE SUNS (20-12): Bledsoe's absence has given Gerald Green a chance to step back into the starting lineup, and the veteran took advantage of the opportunity against Milwaukee. Green scored a team-high 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting, giving Phoenix four straight wins when he tops the 20-point mark. The top 3-point shooter on the Suns, Green has shot 34 percentage points better from the floor in 14 games as a starter than in his 18 games off the bench.ABOUT THE BULLS (14-18): Dunleavy has been one of the few constants for a Chicago team that lost its leader in Derrick Rose earlier this season and has dealt with other various injuries and inconsistencies. Lately, Dunleavy - who is averaging 14.7 points on 62.1 percent shooting in his last three games - has done it in the clutch. He scored 11 of his 20 points against Atlanta in the fourth quarter and shined down the stretch in a 94-82 win over Boston on Thursday, recording seven points, one assist and one blocked shot in the decisive second-half run.BUZZER BEATERS1. Bulls C Joakim Noah is 13-for-39 from the floor over his last four games.2. The Suns have won four of their last five on the road.3.

He doesn't know how to have an improvised moment. He's not wired like that. He's not trying to be antisocial. He's just a bit of an outlawed monk,\" McConaughey said.Harrelson's Hart is more affable on the surface, but quickly the cracks begin to show in his seemingly stable personal life as he struggles to keep his marriage on track as the case takes both him and Rust into treacherous territory.McConaughey and Harrelson, 52, who previously teamed up on 1999 comedy \"EDtv\" and 2008's indie comedy \"Surfer, Dude,\" said they faced challenges in paring back their off-screen buddy chemistry to portray the tense and restrained relationship between Rust and Hart.\"We reciprocate, and that's part of the beauty of our relationship. We add onto each other. We affirm each other... but (in this show), we're not cozying up to each other,\" McConaughey said with Harrelson by his side in an interview peppered with their own amusing side conversations.Their prickly partnership only lasts for the eight episodes of the first season. The series' next installment will feature a different cast and story that have yet to be revealed.TAKING A DARK TURN\"True Detective\" marks yet another step for McConaughey into heftier dramatic roles after years of lighter fare that included goofball romantic comedies like \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\"His darker, grittier projects include 2011's \"Killer Joe\" and 2012's \"Mud.\" The actor has most recently gained critical acclaim and lead acting award nominations at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild for his turn as homophobic drug-addict AIDS sufferer Ron Woodroof in \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"The transition to darker projects coincides with McConaughey settling down in his personal life, now married with three children.\"Having a family, I can definitely measure it as having given me some courage in my career,\" he said.While Harrelson became a household name as bartender Woody Boyd in 1980s TV sitcom \"Cheers\" and has moved between film and TV throughout his career, \"True Detective\" marks McConaughey's first major venture in television, which brought its own challenges to the actor.\"It demanded more patience from me as an actor to say what are the stages of my character,\" McConaughey said.\"This first stage in 1995, where Rust Cohle is very stoic, and boiling underneath, I had to do that for over a month. And after a month, I was getting antsy thinking 'Am I doing enough?'\"In the 17 years, McConaughey's Cohle undergoes a big transformation, from a young clean-cut and determined man to a beer-swigging, pony-tailed cynic.Harrelson, who last year alone alternated between indie drama \"Out of the Furnace,\" big budget franchise \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and animated Thanksgiving film \"Free Birds,\" said he wants to leave the darker projects behind him.\"I love that Matthew is doing these dramas even though I think he's one of the funniest guys I know, but 'Dallas Buyers Club', that was one of the finest performances I've seen in years,\" Harrelson said.\"So it's great that he's doing it, but I'll let (him) do it because I'm over it. I just want to do comedy.\"(Editing byMary MillikenandLisa Shumaker)"], "2014/01/08/il-world-kitchen-llc-idUSnPnCGhpnkj+160+PRN20140108": [0, "2014/01/08", "ROSEMONT, Ill.,Jan. 8, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0More than 85 percent* of Americans agree that soup should be the official meal of winter.

More than 30 judges from a broad spectrum of industries participated in the program, and their average scores determined 2013 CEO World Award winners.In May, ForeSee introduced its Word-of-Mouth Index (WoMI) as an evolution of Net Promoter Score (NPS), which has become the de facto measure of customer loyalty for many organizations. Because NPS fails to distinguish between positive and negative word-of-mouth, ForeSee created WoMI to more accurately measure customers' likelihood to recommend and/or detract from a brand to provide a more precise and actionable measure. WoMI builds on NPS, but is designed to address today's more complex word-of-mouth measurement challenges. It still offers business leaders a single metric for their dashboards and incorporates a NPS score for those who need consistency, but it is based on more sophisticated analytics that enable executives to more accurately evaluate the customer experience across the organization as part of a comprehensive measurement system.\"Winning a CEO World Award for WoMI substantiates our leadership in the evolution of customer experience analytics,\" said ForeSee CEOLarry Freed. \"When it comes to omnichannel customer experience measurement, we're far ahead of the curve.

(NYSE:TMUS) threw \n      down the gauntlet, promising relief for customers fed up with a broken, \n      arrogant wireless industry. Since then, the company has delivered on its \n      promise with a relentless barrage of Un-carrier industry innovations.In its latest move, T-Mobile is eliminating one of the last remaining \n      obstacles for individuals and families wanting to switch from AT&T, \n      Sprint or Verizon to the Un-carrier by offering to pay off their early \n      termination fees. With an eligible phone trade-in, the total value of \n      the offer to switch to T-Mobile could be as high as $650 per line.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving families a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGet Out of Jail Free Card,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Legere, \n      president and chief executive officer of T-Mobile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carriers have \n      counted on staggered contract end dates and hefty early termination fees \n      to keep people bound to them forever. But now families can switch to \n      T-Mobile without paying a single red cent to leave them behind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdCustomers have been flocking to T-Mobile for its no annual service \n      contract Simple Choice Plan, industry-leading JUMP!\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 upgrade program, \n      unlimited global data at no extra charge in 100-plus countries, and most \n      recently for Free Data for Life on every tablet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d up to 200 MB of free \n      4G LTE data every month for as long as they own their tablet and use the \n      registered device with T-Mobile. But Nielsen research suggests up to 40 \n      percentiof families hold back from switching because of high \n      early termination fees (ETFs), and a recent online poll conducted by \n      GigaOM suggests that 78 percentiiwould switch to T-Mobile if \n      their ETF was paid. ETFs can cost as much as $350 per line. Multiply \n      that two, three or four times for a family, and switching becomes an \n      extremely expensive proposition.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carriers like to make you think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just signing up for two years \n      with their family plans, but with staggered expiration dates and early \n      termination fees, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really locking you in forever,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mike \n      Sievert, chief marketing officer for T-Mobile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, families are free \n      to switch without worrying about early termination fees. And by \n      switching to T-Mobile, a family of four can save $1,880 over two years \n      compared to an AT&T shared family planiii.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how T-Mobile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to pay off these fees works:Starting tomorrow, customers from the three major national carriers who \n      hand in their eligible devices at any participating T-Mobile location \n      and switch to a postpaid Simple Choice Plan can receive an instant \n      credit, based on the value of their phone, of up to $300. They then \n      purchase any eligible device, including T-Mobile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular \n      smartphones, now priced at $0 down (plus 24 monthly device payments, for \n      well-qualified customers). After customers get the final bill from their \n      old carrier (showing their early termination fees), they either mail it \n      to T-Mobile or upload it towww.switch2tmobile.com. \n      T-Mobile then sends an additional payment equal to those fees, up to \n      $350 per line. Trade-in of their old phone, purchase of a new T-Mobile \n      phone and porting of their phone number to T-Mobile are required to \n      qualify.This offer to pay early termination fees provides families with a quick \n      way to escape carrier contracts that have deterred them from pursuing a \n      better and more affordable wireless experience with T-Mobile.T-Mobile is also making it easier for its longtime customers to migrate \n      to Simple Choice plans as well without incurring any migration fees. To \n      qualify for this option a current customer under contract trades in \n      their current device and purchases a new T-Mobile device and switches to \n      Simple Choice. In addition to waiving the migration fee, T-Mobile will \n      also eliminate the existing annual service contract for that customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      line.With a Simple Choice Plan from T-Mobile, families start with one line at \n      $50 per month for unlimited talk, text and Web with up to 500 MB of 4G \n      LTE data. They can add a second phone line for $30 per month, and each \n      additional line is just $10 per month. In short, a family could get four \n      lines for just $100 per month (plus taxes and fees). The potential \n      savings are so significant that if every single AT&T, Sprint and Verizon \n      customer switched to a Simple Choice Plan, T-Mobile estimates they would \n      save up to $20 billionivcollectively each year.In addition to great family plan savings, individuals and families can \n      also enjoy an incredible wireless experience thanks to T-Mobile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      rapidly expanding nationwide 4G LTE network \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now the fastestvin the United States.

Cohen, in\nhis defense against criminal insider trading charges, a\nManhattan federal judge ruled.While not offering an opinion on its truthfulness, U.S.\nDistrict Judge Paul Gardephe said Cohen's testimony to the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2012 was not\nsufficiently reliable under federal evidence rules to be\nadmissible at Martoma's trial, now in its second day of jury\nselection.\"When Cohen's deposition was taken, SAC Capital - his\ncompany - was under investigation by the SEC for insider\ntrading,\" the judge wrote in a decision released on Wednesday.\n\"Accordingly, Cohen had a strong motive to offer an exculpatory\nversion of events at SAC. Allowing such self-serving testimony\nto be admitted, without any opportunity for cross-examination,\nwould clearly undermine the purposes of the hearsay rule.\"Gardephe also rejected Martoma's bid to exclude evidence\nabout his role in SAC's trading in drugmakers Elan \nand Wyeth, saying it would present issues for jurors to resolve.\nHe deferred ruling on Martoma's request to exclude evidence of\nother enforcement actions involving SAC and its employees.The decision is a setback for Martoma, who has pleaded not\nguilty to securities fraud and conspiracy charges that were\nbrought by the U.S. Department of Justice.Martoma chose to go to trial rather than cooperate with\nprosecutors, while six other SAC employees pleaded guilty to\ncriminal insider trading charges, and a seventh, Michael\nSteinberg, was found guilty of insider trading last month.Richard Strassberg, a lawyer for Martoma, was not\nimmediately available to comment as he was involved in jury\nselection.Both Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney\nPreet Bharara in Manhattan, and Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman\nfor Cohen, declined to comment.TESTIMONY NOT RELIABLEProsecutors accuse Martoma of arranging trades in Elan and\nWyeth, which is now part of Pfizer Inc, in 2008 after\nobtaining confidential information from doctors about a clinical\ntrial for an Alzheimer's drug.The government said that after learning of negative\ndevelopments in the trial, Martoma spoke by phone with Cohen,\nand SAC then conducted hundreds of millions of dollars in Elan\nand Wyeth transactions. Prosecutors said this enabled SAC to\nmake profits and avoid losses totaling $276 million.Cohen has denied wrongdoing and has not been criminally\ncharged, but he has long been a focus of a government probe.In November, SAC pleaded guilty to fraud, stemming from\nemployees' insider trading. SAC has agreed to pay $1.8 billion\nin criminal and civil settlements.Martoma had hoped to introduce excerpts from Cohen's sworn\ndeposition to show that Cohen, nor Martoma, made the decisions\nto sell Elan and Wyeth shares.But Gardephe concluded the testimony was not reliable enough\nbecause the SEC's questioning was \"exploratory\" rather than\nprosecutorial, and occurred long before prosecutors had\ndeveloped much of a criminal case against Martoma.Moreover, Gardephe added in a seven-paragraph footnote\ndescribing the testimony that much of what Cohen said was\n\"consistent with the government's theory in this case.\"In Wednesday's court proceedings, Gardephe questioned\nprospective jurors for a second day for potential bias.By the end of the day, approximately half of the 80 original\nprospective jurors had been excused for various reasons. Twelve\njurors and four alternates will be picked for the trial, which\nis expected to last three to four weeks.Gardephe told the defense lawyers and prosecutors that they\nwere \"in danger\" of running out of qualified jurors and said he\nmay need to empanel a second set of prospective jurors, a\nprocess that would likely push the start of the trial back at\nleast another day.Once a $14 billion fund, SAC is converting itself into a\n\"family office\" to manage Cohen's own money.The case is U.S. v.

State Senate President Darrell Steinberg, who this week called publicly for Brown's support, did not comment on the omission.Brown's budget plan proposes $154.9 billion in spending from all state funds, which includes the general fund, special funds and bonds funds.Brown's office declined to comment on the leaked report, but aides moved quickly to reschedule the governor's budget presentation for Thursday morning instead of Friday as planned.Among other programs, the budget will include $64.7 million to help pay for a program to make driver's licenses available to undocumented immigrants. The funding includes salaries for 822 staff members.Brown's proposed budget increases spending by about 4 percent for Medi Cal, the state's version of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled, and no longer calls for a retroactive reduction of fees paid to doctors. But the governor's program of fiscal restraint still includes a 10 percent cut in medical fees going forward, which healthcare experts have said would lead many physicians to refuse to accept Medi Cal patients.The plan also proposes using $250 million in funds raised through California's carbon trading program to support the state's planned high-speed rail system, which has run into legal problems and rising criticism.IMPROVING ECONOMYBrown ended a decade of budget deficits in June by signing a spending plan for the current fiscal year with a surplus to help the state set aside $1.1 billion in reserve.California's revenue has been on the upswing as its economy gradually improves and since Brown rallied voters in 2012 to approve temporary increases to the state sales tax and personal income tax rates for the wealthy.Revenue from taxes on the wealthy's capital gains have figured prominently in the state's stronger revenue, which the Legislative Analyst's Office in November said could leave the state with a $2.4 billion reserve for the current fiscal year - more than double the Brown administration's estimate.The reserve could climb to $5.6 billion in the next fiscal year assuming the state's current fiscal policies do not change, the office added.Brown's budget plan notes that California's finances, while improved, face several challenges, including $354.5 billion in long-term liabilities. That includes unfunded pension and other retiree health liabilities of $217.8 billion.Stock market volatility could also hurt California as an estimated 9.9 percent of its general fund revenue in the fiscal year beginning in July is expected to rely on capital gains.The governor said the state also needs to continue paying back internal loans and making good on deferred payments it used to help balance its books in previous years.The cost of that budgetary borrowing has been reduced from $34.7 billion to $24.9 billion this fiscal year and Brown aims to take it down to $13.1 billion in the next fiscal year and wipe it out in the following fiscal year.As part of that effort, Brown wants to fully pay off the Economic Recovery Bonds the state issued in 2004 to help tackle budget deficits with an extra $1.6 billion payment.Two of three major credit rating agencies whose opinions influence California's borrowing costs have cited California's improving finances in upgrades to its general obligation ratings over the past year.(Reporting by Jim Christie in San Francisco; Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento; Editing byLisa Shumaker)"], "2014/01/08/youku-contest-records-idUSnPnCNh1ghn+160+PRN20140108": [0, "2014/01/08", "BEIJING,Jan. 8, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- An annual mobile video contest co-organized by by China Mobile Ltd.

Phase change materials can be segmented into organic, non-organic \n      and bio-based. Increase in total energy supply, growth of construction \n      industry in developed and developing economies and superior heat storage \n      capacity of these materials are a few key drivers which are expected to \n      increase the demand for APCMs. In addition, increasing use of these \n      materials in the textile industry and temperature controlled packaging, \n      coupled with the growth of these industries, is expected to boost the \n      demand over the next few years. However, the high cost and hazardous \n      nature of these materials is expected to hamper the growth of this \n      market. Economic growth in emerging economies of Asia Pacific is \n      expected to open new opportunities for the growth of this market.Paraffin was the largest product segment of this market accounting for \n      over 50% of the market in 2011. It has high heat storing capacity and is \n      chemically stable in nature. However, other product segments of APCM \n      which include bio-based phase change materials are expected to show the \n      fastest growth within the forecast period. Growing demand for bio-based \n      products is expected to be one of the primary factors expected to drive \n      the demand for other phase change materials. In addition, research and \n      development for this product segment is expected to boost its demand. \n      Other product segment is expected to account for over 13% of the market \n      in 2018.APCMs in building and construction were the largest application segment \n      within the market accounting for 24% of the market in 2011. Increasing \n      population in large economies such as China, India and U.S. are driving \n      the construction which in turn is expected to fuel the growth of APCM \n      over the next few years. In addition, demand for green construction is \n      expected to contribute to the growth of the market. Shipping and \n      transportation is expected to be the second-fastest growing application \n      segment of phase change materials. Increase trade activities and \n      development of APCMs which enable transportation of perishable goods \n      such as medicines and food is expected to drive the demand in this \n      application segment. Shipping and transportation is expected to account \n      for over 10% of the market in 2018.Key Topics Covered:Chapter 1 PrefaceChapter 2 Executive SummaryChapter 3 Advanced Phase Change Materials: Industry AnalysisChapter 4 Advanced Phase Change Materials Market: Product Segment \n      AnalysisChapter 5 Advanced Phase Change Materials Market: Application AnalysisChapter 6 Advanced Phase Change Materials: Regional AnalysisChapter 7 Company Profiles- Advansa BV- BASF- Climator Sweden AB- Cryopak- Dow Building Solutions- EI du Pont de Nemours & Company- Honeywell International- Phase Change Products Pty Ltd (PCP)- Rubitherm Technologies GmbH- Salca BVFor more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/79blnh/advanced_phaseResearch and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comU.S. \n      Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716Sector:Advanced \n      Materials"], "2014/01/08/idUSL3N0KI2Y320140108": ["New Issue-EIB prices 1.25 bln SEK 2019 bond", "2014/01/08", "Jan 08 (Reuters) -Following are terms and conditionsof a bond priced on Wednesday.Borrower                European Investment Bank (EIB)Issue Amount            1.25 billion Swedish crownMaturity Date           March 12, 2019Coupon                  2.25 pctReoffer price           99.619Payment Date            January 15, 2014Lead Manager(s)         SEBRatings                 Aaa (Moody's), AAA  (S&P),AAA (Fitch)Listing                 LuxFull fees               0.024 pctDenoms (K)              10Governing Law           EnglishNotes                   Launched under issuer's EMTN programmeSecurity details and RIC, when available, will beonCustomers can right-click on the code forperformance analysis of this new issueFor ratings information, double click onFor all bonds data, double click onFor Top international bonds newsFor news about this issuer, double click on the issuer RIC,where assigned, and hit the newskey (F9 on Reuters terminals)Data supplied by International Insider."], "2014/01/08/usa-education-discipline-idUSL2N0KH28120140108": ["U.S. acts to keep minority, disabled students out of jail", "2014/01/08", "WASHINGTONJan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice and Education\ndepartments unveiled guidelines on Wednesday to prevent schools\nfrom violating civil rights laws and keep students out of jail\nafter data found minorities and the disabled were more likely\nthan others to face discipline or arrest.Attorney General Eric Holder said the guidelines were aimed\nat giving direction to school law enforcement officers,\nprotecting the civil rights of students, and keeping kids in the\nclassroom.\"A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a\nstudent in the principal's office, not in a police precinct,\"\nHolder said in a statement.The guidelines came after the Justice Department sued\nMississippi state and local officials in 2012 over what it\ncalled a \"school-to-prison pipeline\" that violated the rights of\nchildren, especially black and disabled youths.The lawsuit contended that police in Meridian, Mississippi,\nroutinely arrested suspended students even when they lacked\nprobable cause to believe they had committed a crime.The district agreed in March 2013 to change how it\ndisciplined students.The guidelines' principles call for improving school\nenvironments by training staff, engaging families and teaching\nstudents how to resolve conflicts.They also urged schools to understand their obligations\nunder civil rights laws, and the package outlines a host of\nfederal resources regarding school discipline.In an accompanying letter, Education Secretary Arne Duncan\nwrote that department data show black students were three times\nmore likely than whites to be suspended or expelled.Although students with disabilities make up 12 percent of\nU.S. students, they are 19 percent of students who are suspended\nand almost a quarter of those getting a school-related arrest.Holder and Duncan were scheduled to lay out the new\nguidelines at Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore on\nWednesday.\n\n (Reporting byIan Simpson; Editing byDaniel Trottaand Ken\nWills)"], "2014/01/08/research-and-markets-idUSnBw085660a+100+BSW20140108": ["Research and Markets: Filariasis Global Clinical Trials Review, H2, 2013 Research Report", "2014/01/08", "Research and Markets: Filariasis Global Clinical Trials Review, H2, 2013 \n      Research ReportResearch and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kmd68w/filariasis_global) \n      has announced the addition of the\"Filariasis \n      Global Clinical Trials Review, H2, 2013\"report to their \n      offering.Filariasis Global Clinical Trials Review, H2, 2013 provides data on the \n      Filariasis clinical trial scenario.

Loyalist expects that franchising will create substantial high-margin revenues by allowing the Company to earn income from overseas students who choose to study in their own countries.Loyalist is targeting four countries for the launch of the program: Mexico, China, Turkey and South Korea. Setup fees payable by the franchisee to Loyalist range from $0 to $100,000 while royalty rates range from 5-20% of gross revenues (or $50 per student per month).Loyalist has already signed 5 franchise agreements, and expects to add several more franchise agreements per quarter over the coming years.\"Franchising is the logical next step in our evolution towards becoming a truly global brand in the ESL market,\" said CEO Andrew Ryu. \"We are easily the No. 1 choice of foreign students who want to come to Canada. But there are millions of other students who will choose to study in their home countries rather than coming to Canada. These students still want a first-rate curriculum and the ability to earn a recognized diploma, and Loyalist can offer both of those things. We expect this to be highly accretive to our income as the cost of setting up and running this business is small relative to the potential revenues.\"About Loyalist Group (TSX VENTURE:LOY)Loyalist Group Limited owns and operates private English as a Second Language (ESL) Schools, Career Colleges and Community Colleges in Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria and Halifax.Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\u00c2Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Canadian securities laws.

U.S. crude's sharper losses boosted Brent's premium over\nthe domestic benchmark to a fresh one-month high of close to $15\na barrel.The U.S. stock builds come just ahead of refiners entering\nmaintenance season, which will cut in to demand for crude, said\nStephen Schork, editor of The Schork Report in Villanova,\nPennsylvania.\"It's a combination of more supply coming into the market\nwith weak demand and that is indeed weighing on prices,\" he\nsaid.Crude stockpiles at the U.S. oil futures contract delivery\npoint in Cushing, Oklahoma, rose by more than a million barrels,\ndata from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on\nWednesday.Meanwhile, gasoline and diesel stocks rose sharply as\nrefiners continued to process the fuels at a breakneck pace.Brent crude settled down 20 cents at $107.15. U.S\ncrude ended $1.34 lower at $92.33 a barrel. U.S. oil has\nended lower six out of the last seven sessions as growing\nsupplies upend the market.Some traders said the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes\nreleased late on Wednesday fueled selling as the agency outlined\na cautious winding down of its commodity-friendly stimulus\nprogram.The market will look toward Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls\ndata to determine the pace of U.S. economic recovery which could\nfurther hint at the Fed's schedule on rolling back its\nbond-buying program.Others disagreed.\"Crude oil has bigger problems than the Fed,\" said Walter\nZimmermann, a technical analyst at United Icap. \"I think it's\nbest described not by Fed minutes but by the persistent and\ncontinuing growth of crude oil production.\"Rising domestic production and geopolitical stress on Brent\npushed the spread between the two benchmarks wider. Brent's\npremium over U.S. oil stretched to $14.91 per barrel, shrinking\nby day's end CL-LCO1=R to $14.82.A tighter Brent market and well-supplied U.S. market also\nreflected in commodity index rebalancing which supported Brent\nand pushed U.S. crude lower. Some $3 billion will be allocated\nto Brent while U.S. crude will lose about the same amount as the\nStandard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and\nthe Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index reset investment\nallocations.A stronger U.S. dollar also weighed on crude prices as the\nU.S. dollar index, a measure of the dollar's strength\nagainst a basket of currencies, rose to the highest level since\nlate November. When the dollar strengthens, commodities priced\nin the greenback become more expensive to holders of other\ncurrencies.Brent has been underpinned by tensions in Libya, where\ncivil unrest over the last seven months has cut oil exports to\naround 510,000 barrels per day (bpd) from more than 1 million\nbpd in July.On Wednesday the Libyan oil minister said the country would\nsue and stop doing business with any foreign companies that buy\noil from ports seized by protesters, after those protesters\noffered oil at $90 a barrel.Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan warned that its navy could\nsink oil tankers that approach eastern ports controlled by armed\nprotesters led by tribal leader and 2011 civil war hero Ibrahim\nJathran. \n\n (Additional reporting byDavid Sheppardin London, Anna Louie\nSussman in New York and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen in Singapore;\nediting by William Hardy, Chris Reese, Meredith Mazzilli and\nMatthew Lewis)"], "2014/01/08/pa-ricoh-new-study-idUSnPnNYhGjkT+169+PRN20140108": ["Front-line workers have the desire, but not always the means, to delight customers and drive revenue", "2014/01/08", "MALVERN, Pa.,Jan. 8, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0Much has been said about the decline of customer service, but it's especially unfortunate when customer-facing employees desperately want to please \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet can't.This appears to be the case for nearly 9 in 10 (89 percent) of customer-facing employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., bank clerks, call center operators, nurses, bank managers and shop supervisors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who in a new Thought Leadership Paper1commissioned byRicoh Company, Ltd., and conducted by Forrester Consulting, said there's a gap between the experience they can deliver and the experience the customer expects.\"We intuitively understood that less-than-optimal customer service experiences are often traceable to inferior business information workflows,\" saidYoshi Sasaki, General Manager, Business Services Center, Business Solutions Group, Ricoh Company, Ltd. \"In many cases, customer-facing employees are simply too preoccupied trying to find the right information and hampered by working with outdated systems to deliver a personalized, human-to-human experience. We wanted to investigate the problem, and measure it, to help organizations better define and improve their customer service strategies.\"The research found that customer-facing employees, who constitute more than half of the workforce, are critical for companies fighting to emerge from the recession. Unfortunately, gaps in supporting document processes waste time that could be spent personalizing the customer experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a failure that imposes a significant opportunity cost on business.In fact, nearly 1 in 4 managers (23 percent) said poor document services support was a major limitation slowing the effectiveness of customer-facing employees in their organizations. More than 1 in 4 managers (26 percent) cited poor information access as a major limitation.Companies that invest in collaboration, instant messaging, mobile solutions and flexible workplaces make customer-facing workers more efficient and free up more time for them to provide the missing personalized service, according to the study. This assumes companies support these investments with the underlying document processes and systems required to maximize these types of technology.But today, many workers are spending too much time on mundane tasks such as data entry and have trouble with a wide range of activities, including finding facts quickly, creating documents, editing, writing, processing information, solving complex exceptions, and leveraging mobile solutions, according to the study. \"As a result, they are not actively engaged with their customers,\" it states. \"It is by supporting these employees through improved document and process support that organizations will be in a stronger competitive and revenue-driving position.\"Explaining the gapAt the heart of the problem is outdated technology that is often inferior to that used by the customers on the other end of the interaction.More than one-third of managers (36 percent) said their organizations struggle to have the newest technologies, and more than 1 in 4 managers (27 percent) said there's a growing gap between their customers' use of technology and what their customer-facing workers are equipped with. Not surprisingly, information access suffers.This research, detailed in a study called \"The New Workplace Reality: Enterprises Must Capture the Soul and Spirit of the Emerging Worker,\" is based on an online survey by Forrester of 250 global customer service strategy and operations decision-makers, as well as customer-facing individual contributors, betweenMarch 2013andMay 2013.To download the study,mds.ricoh.com/thoughtleadershipAbout the Process ImperativeRicoh's Process Imperative is an ongoing initiative to promote understanding of new document and information processing paradigms that help enterprises leverage the collective wisdom embodied in their organizations.

They ruled out a full sale of the group.\"Selling a majority stake is not an option,\" one of the\nsources said.Letta's office issued a statement saying the meeting looked\nat ways \"to get maximum value out of the company, also with a\nview to its privatisation.\" It gave no details on plans for the\nsale.Shares will be offered to institutional and retail investors\nincluding employees, who may also be able to send\nrepresentatives to the company's board, sources said.The government hopes to conclude the sale before the end of\nthis year to enable proceeds to be used to cut debt from 2014.Poste Italiano declined to comment.The sale of a stake in Poste Italiane would follow the\nBritish government's sale of a 60 percent stake in Royal Mail in\nOctober in an operation that valued the group at 3.3 billion\npounds ($5.43 billion).One source said investor interest in a stake in the Italian\npost office was expected to be strong, but the government will\nalso be wary of repeating the British experience, where unions\nand opposition politicians accused the government of selling the\nRoyal Mail stake too cheaply.Italy, with a public debt expected to stand at 132.8 percent\nof gross domestic product in 2014, a level surpassed only by\nGreece in the European Union, is counting on privatisation\nrevenues to rein it in.In November, Letta announced plans to raise as much as 12\nbillion euros through the sale of stakes in public entities\nincluding oil and gas group Eni, air traffic controller\nEnav and shipbuilder Fincantieri.Italy has promised for years to divest some of its extensive\ncorporate holdings but has had little to show for it. However,\ngrowing pressure from the European Commission to begin reducing\na debt pile that has shot up in the recession of the past two\nyears has added urgency to the plans."], "2014/01/09/research-and-markets-idUSnBw095600a+100+BSW20140109": ["Research and Markets: Heat-Treated Metal Manufacturers (Korea) - Analysis of The Top 100 Companies Including Cheonglim Heat Treatment, Dosco And Hanjung Metal", "2014/01/09", "Research and Markets: Heat-Treated Metal Manufacturers (Korea) - \n      Analysis of The Top 100 Companies Including Cheonglim Heat Treatment, \n      Dosco And Hanjung MetalResearch and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/85l5v9/heattreated) \n      has announced the addition of the\"Heat-Treated \n      Metal Manufacturers (Korea)\"report to their offering.This report provides a detailed overview of the Korean heat-treated \n      metal manufacturers market and delivers a comprehensive individual \n      analysis on the top 100 companies.

Clinical proof-of-concept of \n      galeterone in CRPC has been completed and results from the ongoing \n      ARMOR2 Phase 2 trial will be used to define the Phase 3 trials planned \n      for initiation in the second half of 2014.About Tokai PharmaceuticalsTokai Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on \n      developing new treatments for prostate cancer and other hormonally \n      driven cancers.

changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, and the ability to manage our inventory commensurate with customer demand, could adversely impact our sales levels and profitability; fluctuations in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor and transportation, could cause manufacturing delays and increase our costs; our growth strategy relies significantly on international expansion, which requires significant capital investment, adds complexity to our operations and may strain our resources and adversely impact current store performance; our international expansion plan is dependent on a number of factors, any of which could delay or prevent successful penetration into new markets or could adversely affect the profitability of our international operations; our direct-to-consumer operations are subject to numerous risks that could adversely impact sales; equity-based compensation awarded under the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer could adversely impact our cash flows, financial position or results of operations and could have a dilutive effect on our outstanding Common Stock;

our reliance on two distribution centers domestically and two third-party distribution centers internationally makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our distribution centers; we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with credit card fraud and identity theft that would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues; our facilities, systems and stores, as well as the facilities and systems of our vendors and manufacturers, are vulnerable to natural disasters, pandemic disease and other unexpected events, any of which could result in an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operating results;

The drug is being tested for that\ncondition in a late-stage study.\"It's a huge opportunity for the company as there are over\n10 million (NASH) patients worldwide,\" Wedbush analyst Liana\nMoussatos said.She said Intercept could conduct a late-stage trial for the\ndrug, either with partner Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma,\nwhich is testing the drug in Japan, or through a tie-up with Big\nPharma.\"Our intention right now is to hold on to our ex-Asia\nworldwide rights ... We've demonstrated that we can very capably\ntake this compound forward in a number of indications,\" CEO\nPruzanski said on a conference call with analysts.He did not, however, rule out a future partnership.ACQUISITION TARGET?Oppenheimer & Co analyst Akiva Felt said the drug's value\ncould be best captured through an acquisition of the company.\"Gilead would probably be most likely (to acquire\nthe company). Other companies with a big presence in the liver\ndisease space would be AbbVie and Brisol-Myers\n,\" he said.Obeticholic acid, Intercept's lead drug, is also being\ntested in mid-stage studies to treat bile acid diarrhea and\nportal hypertension - high blood pressure in veins that\ntransport blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to\nthe liver.The drug's structure is similar to that of a naturally\noccurring human bile acid.Intercept said the safety committee made the recommendation\nto stop the trial after reviewing liver biopsy data from about\nhalf of the 283 patients enrolled in the mid-stage trial.There is currently no specific treatment for NASH, according\nto the U.S. National Institutes of Health.To manage the disease, patients are recommended to maintain\na healthy weight, follow a balanced diet, increase physical\nactivity and avoid alcohol.Intercept shares closed up 281 percent at $275.87.\n\n (Reporting by Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti\nPandey, Anthony Kurian)"], "2014/01/09/idUSL3N0KJ4JI20140109": ["New Issue-Veneto Banka prices 350 mln Euro 2017 bond", "2014/01/09", "Jan 9 (Reuters) -Following are terms and conditionsof a bond priced on Thursday.Borrower                Veneto Banca SCPAIssue Amount            350 million euroMaturity Date           January 20, 2017Coupon                  4 pctIssue price             99.654Reoffer price           99.654Yield                   4.125 pctSpread                  337 basis pointsUnderlying govt bond    Over Mid-Swaps, equivalent to 379bpOver 1.25 pct 10/14/2016 OBL #161Payment Date            January 20, 2014Lead Manager(s)         Banca IMI, Deutsche Bank, Banca Aletti & NatixisRatings                 BB (S&P)Listing                 LuxFull fees               UndisclosedDenoms (K)              100-1Notes                   Launched under issuer's EMTN programmeISIN                    XS1016053537Security details and RIC, when available, will beonCustomers can right-click on the code forperformance analysis of this new issueFor ratings information, double click onFor all bonds data, double click onFor Top international bonds newsFor news about this issuer, double click on the issuer RIC,where assigned, and hit the newskey (F9 on Reuters terminals)"], "2014/01/09/db-x-trackers-msci-canad-idUSnBw095479a+100+BSW20140109": [0, "2014/01/09", "Net Asset Value(s)FUND\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 db x-trackers MSCI Canada Index UCITS ETFDEALING DATE\u00c2\u00a6 08-Jan-14NAV PER SHARE\u00c2\u00a6 USD48.3467NUMBER OF SHARES IN ISSUE\u00c2\u00a6 435,000CODE\u00c2\u00a6db x-trackers MSCI Canada"], "2014/01/09/danone-new-zealand-idUSL3N0KI4JH20140109": ["UPDATE 4-Danone to sue New Zealand's Fonterra over baby formula recall", "2014/01/09", "* Fonterra says to \"vigorously\" contest suit* Lawsuit comes as Fonterra cuts earnings, dividend forecast* Danone to stop buying Fonterra products* Fonterra units down 1.7 pct; Danone shares down nearly 1\npctByNaomi TajitsuandGeert De ClercqWELLINGTON/PARIS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - French food group Danone\n said it would sue wholesale dairy exporter Fonterra\n and stop buying products from the New Zealand firm\nfollowing a contamination scare that sparked the recall of\ninfant milk formula across Asia.The world's largest yoghurt maker did not say how much money\nit was seeking, but it has previously said it wanted full\ncompensation for what it says were 350 million euros ($476\nmillion) in lost sales following the recall of the company's\nDumex and Karicare infant formula products.Danone buys a range of dairy ingredients from Fonterra, but\nis one of its biggest customers for milk powder, according to\nanalysts who cover the sector. Fonterra, which said it would\ncontest the suit \"vigorously\", declined to give details on its\nsales to the French firm.Danone has said that Fonterra supplied about 16 percent of\nthe milk ingredients for its baby food business, which accounts\nfor 20 percent of its total revenue.In August, Fonterra said it had found a potentially fatal\ningredient in a range of products sold by multinational\ncompanies. After recalls were issued across nine countries\nincluding China, the scare turned out to be a false alarm\nbecause the ingredient was found to contain a less harmful\nbacteria.In a statement, Danone said it was starting proceedings in\nthe New Zealand High Court against the world's largest dairy\nprocessor, as well as arbitration proceedings in Singapore to\nbring all facts to light and obtain compensation.The company said it was also terminating its supply contract\nwith Fonterra and would make any further collaboration\ncontingent on a commitment by Fonterra to full transparency and\ncompliance with Danone's food safety procedures.\"This affair illustrates serious failings on Fonterra's part\nin applying the quality standards required in the food\nindustry,\" Danone said.Danone told Reuters it would source products from other\nfirms, without elaborating.Other potential suppliers could include Glanbia,\nwhich is building a new milk powder plant in Ireland, and Arla\nFoods, which recently told Reuters it has \"massively\nbenefited\" from a desire by milk powder buyers to diversify\nsupply after the food safety scare and a drought last year\nhighlighted the risk of over-reliance on one supplier.Some dairy brands in China, for example, have started to\nlook to diversify.Glanbia and Fonterra's much smaller competitors in New\nZealand would not comment on whether they had seen more business\nfrom Danone as a result of the dispute. Arla was not immediately\navailable.Danone's decision to halt purchases may be an effort to\ndistance itself from the source of the perceived problem.\"It's all about trying to rebuild their brand,\" said an\nanalyst, who added that Danone was unlikely to face any supply\ninterruption. \"This isn't a panic decision today. They've been\nlooking at (diversifying) since the minute it happened.\"Danone has a cushion, the analyst said, since the sudden,\nsharp drop in consumer demand means there is a large amount of\nproduct that still needs to be sold.Fonterra, a farmer-owned co-operative, has denied any legal\nliability to Danone regarding the recall.\"Fonterra has been in ongoing commercial discussions with\nDanone and is disappointed that they have resulted in legal\naction,\" the company said in a statement.Shares in Fonterra's trading fund closed down 1.7\npercent, while Danone shares were down 0.7 percent at 1245 GMT.SETTLED WITH SEVERAL CUSTOMERSThe two sides started negotiations in October, after Danone\nrecalled its Dumex formula products in China, where demand for\nforeign branded infant formula is high due to a series of\ndomestic food quality issues. It is a key growth market at a\ntime of sluggish demand in Europe.Eight companies issued product recalls in August. Danone is\nthe first to take legal action against Fonterra. In December,\nFonterra said it had reached agreements to compensate six firms\nand that it was \"very, very close\" to an agreement with an\naffected nutritional company.New Zealand's largest company controls roughly one-third of\nglobal dairy exports and is a major wholesale supplier of milk\npowder used in milk formula and other food products marketed by\nDanone, Nestle and other multinationals.A big court settlement in Danone's favour would hurt\nFonterra's bottom line given that it has already slashed its\nearnings and dividend forecast on the back of rising production\ncosts at a time when it is struggling to keep up with soaring\ndemand for milk powder.\"A large fine of the magnitude that Danone ... has stated\nwould have a material impact. You'd have to either remove your\ndividend or address your capital structure,\" said Rickey Ward,\nhead of equities at Tyndall Investment Management in Auckland.Ward said that given strong global demand for dairy\nproducts, particularly from China, Fonterra was unlikely to have\nproblems finding new buyers to replace cancelled orders.\"It's not nice to lose a big customer ... (But) there's\nlarge global demand and short supply so Fonterra may be able to\nfill that void if there is a big void,\" he said."], "2014/01/09/ca-popchips-hire-idUSnPnNYj1Ykl+164+PRN20140109": ["paul davis joins popchips as ceo", "2014/01/09", "SAN FRANCISCO,Jan. 9, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0popchips todayannounced that former kettle ceo and consumer products veteran, paul davis, will take over as ceo of the award winning popped snack company. davis was most recently the ceo of coinstar/redbox, where the company quadrupled its revenues and earnings under his leadership.\u00c2\u00a0 in his new role, davis will focus on takingpopchipsto the next level and capitalize on the fast growing better-for-you snacking segment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2(Logo:http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140109/NY43366LOGO)davis succeeds co-founder and chairman, keith belling, as ceo, \u00c2\u00a0and co-founder and president, patrick turpin,\u00c2\u00a0who are excited about bringing on someone\u00c2\u00a0of paul's caliber to continue to growpopchips.both belling and turpin will remain actively involved as founders with belling serving as chairman, remaining focused on the company's global strategy.\"paul's record of achievement combined with his leadership, operating experience, passion for great brands and innovation make him the ideal candidate to leadpopchipsinto the future,\" said keith belling, co-founder and chairman ofpopchips. \"paul's success transitioning from the founder at kettle while embracing and building on kettle's rich culture and team dynamic, further assured us he was the perfect choice.\"davis's background\u00c2\u00a0 includes over 16 years of experience in the snack industry, including serving as ceo of kettle foods and\u00c2\u00a0 nearly 14 years at frito-lay where he served as chief customer officer and then president of frito-lay in canada.\u00c2\u00a0 davis, who started his career at procter and gamble, also served as president of north america for starbucks.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\"i've been a huge fan ofpopchipssince they launched and created the popped category. the brand has a \u00c2\u00a0tremendous following and i look forward to working with the team to further enhance its position as one of the leading brands in the better for you snack category,\" said paul davis. \"you can't walk down the snack aisle without seeing the impactpopchipshas had on the category. i'm thrilled to be joining the team and helping take the brand to the next level.\"davis will oversee allpopchipsoperations, including the u.s., canada and u.k., where he will build on the brand's great success while nurturing the company's culture of innovation, continue building strong retail partnerships, and execute even more creative marketing campaigns.\u00c2popchipsare now available at over 30,000 retailers across north america and the u.k., including whole foods, safeway, target, kroger, wegmans, loblaws, waitrose, sainsbury's, tesco and costco, and other independent and specialty chains, as well as onamazon.com.\u00c2\u00a0 for more information on popchips, visitpopchips.comorpopchips.co.uk.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2SOURCE  popchips"], "2014/01/09/idUSnCCN8GwJFr+1d6+MKW20140109": ["First Asset Closed-End Funds Confirms Distributions for Year-End 2013", "2014/01/09", "First Asset Closed-End Funds Confirms Distributions for Year-End 2013TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired -

The U.S. Department of State hosted the meeting.\"The exploration and utilization of space benefits all humankind,\" Secretary of StateJohn Kerrysaid in a written statement. \"They further promote innovation and economic development, foster scientific advancement, and inspire the next generation of explorers to pursue studies and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Government-level involvement in and support for human and robotic space exploration are critical to realizing these benefits. The ISEF provides us with an opportunity to strengthen international cooperation through discussions of policy issues relevant to the exploration, long-term sustainability, development, and utilization of this important domain.\"Holdren touted the benefits of continuing to operate the orbiting laboratory for at least another decade in his remarks.\"The ISS is a unique facility that offers enormous scientific and societal benefits,\" said Holdren. \"The Obama Administration's decision to extend its life until at least 2024 will allow us to maximize its potential, deliver critical benefits to our Nation and the world, and maintain American leadership in space.\"NASA AdministratorCharles Boldenemphasized in a keynote speech the importance of the role space exploration has played in scientific discovery in space and on Earth, and the ways exploration has led to new technologies.\"NASA is committed to the space station as a long-term platform to enable the utilization of space for global research and development,\" Bolden said. \"We're committed to implementing a unified strategy of deep space exploration, with robotic and human missions to destinations that include near-Earth asteroids, the moon and Mars.

This ISEF meeting continued the dialogue initiated by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, and most recently held inItalyinNovember 2011, which underscored the importance of space exploration, and its benefit to all citizens of the world. As host of the ISEF,the United Statesexpressed its strong commitment to advance space exploration and urged all nations to join together to extend humanity's reach into the solar system.ISEF participants noted that space exploration represents the ultimate challenge in our quest to explore new frontiers and expand our collective sense of humanity's place in the universe. All participants confirmed that innovation and knowledge derived from space exploration directly contribute to economic growth and societal well-being.Discussions highlighted that many of the spaceflight achievements of the past half-century would not have been possible without international cooperation. Competition-driven innovation at the industrial and scientific levels is also an important element for the evolution of space exploration. Currently, working together, nations are successfully leveraging their strengths and executing multiple robotic and human space missions with broad societal benefits. Nations are coordinating efforts to better understand our planet and to expand our reach to a variety of solar system destinations, including asteroids, the Moon, and Mars. Nations participating in the ISEF recognized that human and robotic space exploration generates benefits for people on Earth and will be most successful by building on accomplishments and expanding partnerships with the long-term goal of human exploration of Mars. ISEF participants also noted the importance of policy-level commitment for realization and sustainable implementation of international endeavors in space exploration.ISEF participants supported the work of space agencies participating in the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) in developing a strategic roadmap for human space exploration documented in the 2013 Global Exploration Roadmap released in August. They welcomed an expansion of efforts to increase synergies between human and robotic missions to maximize the unique contribution made by each and their collective contribution to common goals.They recognized the value of the stepwise approach to exploration, enabling nations to demonstrate advanced space exploration capabilities through cooperative international missions which allow individual national priorities to be met while achieving shared long-term goals. They encouraged broadened participation in ISECG from additional space agencies.As part of this common vision for space exploration, ISEF participants recognized the importance of the International Space Station (ISS) as the largest, most complex international scientific and engineering project in history. In addition to the benefits of continuing research, technology demonstrations, and experimentation, the ISS partnership illustrates that nations can collaboratively design, fund and complete an expansive and complex project. In light of the research that has been conducted by more than 80 nations, the ISS partners encouraged expanded international access to this unprecedented facility, and noted its continuing value to future exploration endeavors. ISEF participants acknowledged the need to continue making concrete steps fostering international cooperation for additional space exploration projects, programs and activities.ISEF participants recognized the growth in commercial spaceflight activities. Such private sector efforts expand economic growth, bring new vitality and ideas, and enhance space exploration. ISEF participants emphasized the importance of commercial spaceflight in exploration activities in accordance with existing national and international guidelines.ISEF participants acknowledged that the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) is an important venue in which spacefaring and non-spacefaring nations alike can continue to discuss important issues regarding expanding humanity's horizons in space and furthering the objectives of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space. These globally important issues include the long-term sustainability of the space environment for all users, and protecting Earth from potentially hazardous objects. With the participation for the first time by a number of developing countries in space exploration, ISEF also recognized the value of space activities in promoting sustainable development. ISEF participants noted the need for discussion of international frameworks and common principles for collaboration on future space exploration, drawing on the experience of projects such as the ISS.The ISEF participants welcomed an offer fromJapanto host the next space exploration dialogue in 2016 or 2017 and agreed that policy level consultations should continue in the interim until the next meeting. They committed to convey the results of the ISEF to various stakeholders within their respective governments.SOURCE  NASA"], "2014/01/09/ny-fitch-ratings-revlon-idUSnBw095962a+100+BSW20140109": ["Fitch: Consumer Products Exit China in Favor of Profitable Growth", "2014/01/09", "Fitch: Consumer Products Exit China in Favor of Profitable GrowthThe recent exit of Revlon Consumer Products and L'Oreal S.A's Garnier \n      brand from China is an affirmation of the sectors focus on profitable \n      growth, according to Fitch Ratings. From Procter & Gamble (P&G), with \n      over $80 billion in revenues, to Revlon Consumer Products, Inc., with \n      pro forma revenues of $2 billion, the pursuit of revenue growth at all \n      costs has become less fashionable in a slow-growth and volatile global \n      markets environment.In the short term, focusing investments that have higher margin and cash \n      flow potential is positive. Due to insufficient scale or pricing power, \n      operating in China is not always profitable for global fast-moving \n      consumer goods companies. However, there could be longer term negative \n      implications with a complete exit from a large market such as China, \n      which has significant potential.Geographic exits are not unique to China. Kimberly-Clark Corp. is \n      exiting $500 million in tissue businesses in Western Europe, which is \n      considered a highly competitive and slow growth market. However, there \n      is concern when companies exit markets such as China where sheer \n      demographics support long-term growth. Further, many companies find it \n      more difficult to re-enter a market after incumbents have had time to \n      invest and capture large market shares. Re-entering large markets at a \n      later stage may require heavier investments, including merger and \n      acquisitions (M&As).Fitch regards these exits on a case-by-case basis. L'Oreal, with \n      significant rating headroom, is merely putting its muscle behind other \n      brands in China and will still retain access to China's potential. \n      Complete exits such as Revlon are understandable from a short-term \n      perspective, as the company does not appear to have the scale and \n      financial flexibility to compete and invest in China's vast and \n      fragmented retail market, and its margins and profitability will benefit \n      in the near term. However, Revlon's presence in other emerging markets \n      is relatively small, and given the Colomer acquisition, its exposure to \n      the U.S. and Western European markets increases. The benefit in the near \n      term might hamper its longer term growth.Avon Products, Inc. also has issues in China, and given the sector focus \n      on profitable growth, exiting could make financial sense in the short \n      term. Avon has some flexibility to invest further, though less than \n      several years ago. The long-term potential of the world's largest \n      population and the difficulty of re-entering and building a sales force \n      are likely behind the company's decision to continue trying to stabilize \n      operations in China. Nonetheless, Fitch notes that management is \n      pragmatic in balancing financial flexibility versus revenue growth and \n      exited both South Korea and Vietnam in 2012.Additional information is available onwww.fitchratings.com.The above article originally appeared as a post on the Fitch Wire credit \n      market commentary page.

The deal will facilitate syndication of more than$100 millionto dramatically increase the number of transactions Wiser Capital handles annually and provide a larger pool of financing for the rapidly growing mid-scale commercial solar sector.Wiser Capital recently launched the country's first online platform for efficient sourcing, scoring and direct funding of mid-scale commercial solar projects. The platform offers a secure, centralized marketplace connecting key stakeholders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d energy investors, host facilities and photovoltaic (PV) systems integrators \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in the asset class comprised of these sustainable energy projects.The deal will allow Wiser Capital to serve a larger audience of potential host facilities, and inject more capital into that mid-scale market for the entire industry.\"We are now poised to secure more solar on commercial property and provide a larger pool of financing for an integration community that's starving for funding,\" saidNathan Homan, Managing Partner at Wiser Capital. \"This deal will ultimately mean lower cost power for host facilities, more business growth for the integrators, and the creation of more jobs for Americans.\"The deal is also a critical step for Wiser because of the vital role that community banks can play in transforming financing for solar projects. Distributed generation (DG) commercial solar projects, with sizes ranging from 50 kilowatts to 2 megawatts, are currently underserved by financial institutions and are an ideal asset class for credit starved community banks. The projects generally fall into the preferred financing range for community banks, with individual funding requirements between$250,000 and $5 million.\"This is a prime space for community banks. It's a perfect time for them to be aggressive in the marketplace, seize an opportunity to release money into the economy and invest in projects in their own backyards,\" Mr. Homan said.Community banks interested in learning more about financing solar projects can view Wiser Capital and other industry leaders on an upcoming National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) sponsored webinar, titled Banking on Solar. \u00c2\u00a0Details on the webinar's date and agenda will be sent to banking industry leaders, their trade groups and banking regulators.For media inquiries, please contactKris Kagelat 973-850-7312 orkkagel@jcprinc.com.About Wiser CapitalWiser Capital is a financial services \u00c2\u00a0firm based inSanta Barbara, Calif., that enables new sources of qualifying capital to participate in the funding of financially attractive, stable and secure sources of renewable energy, with an innovative direct investment vehicle for third-party financed medium-scale commercial photovoltaic (PV) energy projects.

A\nSenate aide said two more joined on Thursday, to bring the total\nto 56.It is uncertain whether the bill will be introduced on the\nSenate floor and whether backers can win the two-thirds majority\nto overcome a veto by President Barack Obama.A senior Senate Democratic aide said there were no plans yet\nfor advancing the bill to the Senate floor, despite the growing\nlist of co-sponsors.The bill would also place sanctions on Iran if it does not\nagree to a comprehensive deal later this year or next. The\nUnited States and five other world powers agreed to a six-month\ninterim deal with Iran in Geneva in November, that can be\nextended to a year.Under last year's interim agreement, Iran will get access to\nbillions of dollars worth of funds that had been cut off by\nsanctions in return for limiting enrichment of uranium.At least 15 Democrats support the bill introduced in\nDecember by Robert Menendez, the chairman of the Foreign\nRelations Committee, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican.The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an advocacy\ngroup with strong ties to many lawmakers, has said it supports\nnew sanctions that would take effect if Iran violates the\ninterim pact or does not agree to an \"acceptable\" comprehensive\ndeal.The bill seeks to cut Iran's oil exports to zero two years\nafter implementation. It also puts limits on the Obama\nadministration's ability to waive sanctions.There is tough resistance to the measure by many other\nDemocrats, however. A bloc of 10 Democratic senators, all\nleaders of committees, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader\nHarry Reid last month expressing their opposition to the bill.The aide said more support could come soon from the bloc of\nDemocrats. \"At least two that I know of are inching toward\npublic support for the bill,\" the aide said on condition of\nanonymity given the sensitivity of the talks.There has been no public indication from any of the 10 that\nthey were leaning toward shifting position on the issue.Nine senior foreign policy experts, including Ryan Crocker,\na former ambassador to Iraq and the Afghanistan, this week urged\nMenendez and Kirk to not pass the new sanctions, saying they\ncould potentially move the United States closer to war.\n\n (Additional reporting byRichard Cowan; Editing by Alistair\nBell and Rosalind Russell)"]}

Fighting in the oil-producing nation has killed at least 1,000 people and caused hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.Kiir, in turn, has refused to release 11 detainees despite promising last month that he would free most of them.Ban also said that around 75,000 civilians have been seeking refuge at U.N. peace keeping bases across South Sudan.

The amount of favorable reviews for the Mayan\n Palace shows that these fraud accounts are fabricated.CANCUN, Mexico,Jan. 10, 2014/PRNewswire/ - Stories of fraud circulate online\n frequently, in some cases it is cause for alarm and, at the very least,\n an investigation into the culprit.The Mayan Palace family of Mexican resortsrecently came under fire on the Internet because of supposed fraud\n practices they were using. But how did the Mayan Palace fraud accounts\n compare to actual customer reports?In comparing the online fraud accounts to actual customer reviews there\n is no clear evidence of any scam being perpetuated. In fact, there were\n above-average ratings being posted across the board, showing content\n families and travelers who had overwhelmingly positive experiences. The\n Mayan Palace group of luxury resortshave achieved amazing reviews on the world's most popular travel sites, with new reviews by happy travelers being added on a weekly basis. So\n how does the Mayan Palace, an extravagant resort that seems to be well\n received by its customers, have an unusual amount of people reporting\n fraud? It could possibly be a tactic being used to discredit the resort\n or take away potential customers. Although the true reason for the\n reports may never be revealed, they are certainly not congruous with\n the positive statements being made in support of the Mayan Palace.So what is the final verdict in theMayan Palace fraudcase?

Christie's political opponents have said the closures were part of a vendetta against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, at the New Jersey end of the George Washington Bridge, because he had declined to endorse the Republican governor's re-election effort.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey said on Thursday that office was reviewing the allegations, which are already the subject of a state legislature inquiry and a Port Authority inspector general review.But a lack of relevant federal statutes, and a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that narrowed a public corruption law, could prevent federal authorities from advancing the preliminary review into a criminal case.\"They are probably combing through the statute book looking for statutes that haven't been used in a long time because one does not jump out at you,\" said Andrew Lourie, a former chief of the Justice Department's public integrity section and now a defense lawyer at Kobre & Kim LLP.There has been no suggestion so far that any money changed hands, and most federal corruption laws require prosecutors to prove that money was involved or some explicit quid-pro-quo took place.Christie, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, said on Thursday he had no knowledge that his staff was involved in the four-day lane closings on the bridge and fired a top aide at the center of the scandal.The closures caused hours-long traffic jams that stalled commuters, school buses and emergency vehicles.Responsible officials could face private lawsuits from individuals harmed by the delays, or they could face charges under state law.A federal investigation could have been more conceivable before the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in the case of former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling, experts said.In that case, the high court pared back a law that says public officials or others can be prosecuted for failing to provide the public with its \"intangible right to honest services.\" Instead, the court said prosecutors had to prove bribes or kickbacks were at issue.One open question is whether any of the fired officials will provide investigators with incriminating information or turn on their former superiors.One of those officials, former Port Authority executive David Wildstein, appeared on Thursday before a state legislative panel investigating the matter. But he declined to answer questions, repeatedly invoking the constitutional protection not to say anything that might incriminate him.Another issue is whether any evidence surfaces that shows state officials obstructed federal agents looking into the matter or lied to them.\"If the feds are investigating, there is always the danger to anyone being investigated, that if they are not 100 percent truthful, or they delete or destroy or hide evidence, then they could be guilty of obstruction of justice,\" said Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor who helped prosecute former Bush administration official Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby on similar grounds.Libby, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was convicted in 2007 of obstructing a CIA leak probe.But Zeidenberg said barring new evidence, he did not anticipate a criminal case from federal prosecutors.\"It's political payback and it's mischief, but crime? I can't think of one,\" said Zeidenberg, now a lawyer with DLA Piper. \"There are some creative people over there - maybe they'll come up with something.\"(Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; additional reporting by David Ingram and Edward Krudy; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Dan Grebler)"], "2014/01/10/oh-polycase-new-idUSnPnPHjbbhY+161+PRN20140110": ["Polycase\u00c2\u00ae Introduces New Line of American Manufactured Hinged Waterproof Electrical Enclosures", "2014/01/10", "AVON, Ohio,Jan. 10, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- Polycase introduces the new YH Series ofNEMA-rated hinged electrical enclosures. \u00c2\u00a0The YH Series is available in eight sizes, ranging from 6\"x 4\" through 16\"x 14\" and is molded from impact-resistant polycarbonate.

It was just his third goal of the year, coming on a 2-on-1 break with center Derek MacKenzie.\"It was a big, big play, obviously, for (MacKenzie) to get it over to Mark (Letestu) on the penalty kill and get us going,\" said Columbus left winger Nick Foligno, who scored his 12th goal of the season in the second period. \"We just took off from there.\"You need that. You need those breaks in momentum. You get a big one like that and we just get rolling from there. It was a huge goal for us, and then you see we take off and get three more and it puts us in the driver's seat.\"Letestu added his fourth goal of the season midway through the third period.Cam Atkinson also scored for the Blue Jackets, beating Winnipeg goalie Ondrej Pavelec in the second period for his 13th goal of the year.Left winger Eric O'Dell scored his first NHL goal to give Winnipeg a 1-0 first-period lead, and center Bryan Little, with his 15th of the season, and defenseman Tobias Enstrom, with his fifth, chipped in with goals.Pavelec stopped 20 shots for Winnipeg and Columbus netminder Curtis McElhinney was strong with a 28-save performance.Coming off a victory at home against Carolina on Friday, the Blue Jackets won on back-to-back nights for the first time during the 2013-14 campaign.\"That's what we pride ourselves on, everyone buying in every single night,\" said Jenner, 20. \"We're going to have games where it's tough for us, but as long as we have that work and that will, we know we're a good team. We just have to keep that up.\"His goal on a penalty shot in the second period after he was hauled down by Jets blue-liner Adam Pardy proved to be the winner.\"We can tell in the room we believe in ourselves and we know when we play that way we can do some good things,\" Jenner said. \"We can't look too far ahead, we just have to stay focused on the very next game and that's Monday. That's a huge game at home.\"The Blue Jackets host the Tampa Bay Lightning to start the week.Jets coach Claude Noel mixed up his lines, shifting defenseman Dustin Byfuglien to the right wing, where he played occasionally when he was with the Chicago Blackhawks. But it didn't provide the desired effect, and there were plenty of boos raining down from the MTS Centre crowd.\"I thought we played with some energy in the first (period). We had chances to make it more than 1-0,\" Noel said. \"But the game unraveled in the second period on mistakes that I'd never seen before. It was wild. Some of the breakdowns I've never seen before.\"We suffer from confidence, that's clear. There are things we aren't doing well. We're not defending well, but we're not even passing well. Right now, adversity is the enemy and we are not dealing with it very well.\"NOTES: Four Columbus goals in the second period on Saturday night are the most the Jets have surrendered in a period on home ice this season. ... Getting a much-deserved break was G Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 36 saves for his second shutout of the season in the Blue Jackets' 3-0 victory over the Hurricanes on Friday night. The Vezina Trophy winner as the league's top goaltender last season is 12-11-2 this season. ... Jets LW Evander Kane, who is nursing a hand injury, took a quick 10-minute skate in the morning before leaving the ice before practice was over. He did not dress for the game, which would have been the 300th of his career. ... Columbus RW Nathan Horton entered the game just one goal shy of 200 for his career. ... A year ago, Winnipeg D Jacob Trouba was logging big minutes for the Michigan Wolverines. Now, the 19-year-old leads all NHL rookies in average ice time (21:10) per game. ... The Blue Jackets like to crash and bang. The club came into the game leading the NHL in road hits (695) and was fourth in total hits (1,350)."], "2014/01/11/bkc-notredame-georgiatech-recap-idUSMTZEA1B94D48X20140111": ["Georgia Tech 74, Notre Dame 69", "2014/01/11", "Georgia Tech 74, Notre Dame 69: Trae Golden scored 20 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 42 seconds remaining, as the host Yellow Jackets rebounded after blowing a 15-point second-half advantage to win their first ACC game of the season.Daniel Miller finished with 10 points,13 rebounds and four blocked shots for Georgia Tech (10-6, 1-2), which had lost its initial two conference games by an average of 19 points.

Many experts speculate the early\nenrollees were more likely to be in urgent need of coverage, and\ntherefore more likely to be older or sicker.A recent survey by The Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare\nresearch foundation, found that 41 percent of those who had\nshopped at the various state marketplaces by the end of December\nwere ages 19 to 34, up from 32 percent from an October survey.One marketplace with current data, the District of Columbia,\nsaid on Friday that of the 3,646 enrollees in private plans\nthrough Thursday, about 44 percent are young adults.Healthcare experts say many young healthy people may sign up\nonly at the end of enrollment on March 31 to avoid paying the\nlaw's penalty for not having health insurance.A FACTOR OF PRICEThe Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare,\nprevents insurers from charging people more if they have a\nhealth problem. Age is one of the few factors that can affect\nthe price, with insurers allowed to charge up to three times\nmore for a 64-year-old than someone in their early 20s.But the healthcare costs for a 64-year-old on average are\nnearly five times as much as a 21-year-old, according to a study\nof claims from three large insurers Yamamoto conducted for the\nSociety of Actuaries.\"The more that the marketplace is able to attract a broad\nmix of enrollees including the young and healthy ... the more\nthat costs will be sustainable and premiums will be more\naffordable,\" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's\nHealth Insurance plans, a trade group for insurers.Other factors may be as crucial, if not more, in determining\nthe stability of the new market, including the health status of\nenrollees, regardless of their age, and how that lines up with\nwhat individual insurers had projected. But those details will\nonly become clearer later in the year based on the medical\nclaims filed by the newly insured, making age the best early\nproxy about whether the market is sustainable.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which\noversees the marketplace for 36 states, has yet to provide any\ndemographic data about enrollees. CMS is expected to release an\nenrollment report later this month.Data may come sooner from insurers as they discuss their\nrecent financial performance with investors in the next few\nweeks. Humana Inc said on Thursday that the mix of\nenrollment in its marketplace plans were likely to be \"more\nadverse than previously expected.\"But healthcare experts say insurers need a better mix of\nenrollees than seen in the early data.\"If a quarter or more of the enrollees are young adults, I\nwould think that's an encouraging sign, particularly for the\nfirst half of the open enrollment period,\" said Larry Levitt,\nsenior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation healthcare\nthink-tank.By the end of March, \"if it's lower than that, I think there\nwould be some cause for concern,\" Levitt said.Levitt and colleagues at Kaiser analyzed a scenario that\nthey deemed \"worst case\" in which young adults represented 25\npercent of enrollees. They found that costs then would be about\n2.4 percent higher, but insurers would retain a very slim profit\nmargin. As a result, the Kaiser authors projected the companies\nwould raise premiums by a commensurate amount, but not enough to\ndestabilize the market.Using the same data as Kaiser but different assumptions,\nSeth Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston who\nspecializes in insurance, said costs would be 3.5 percent\nhigher, should only 25 percent of enrollees be young adults.\"If we see fewer than 30 percent of the enrollees being in\nthat 18-to-34 age bracket, that's a warning sign that there are\nproblems,\" Chandler said. \"If the demographics come in poorly,\ninsurers are going to lose money.\"Chandler is a skeptic of the healthcare law and writes a\nblog called \"ACA Death Spiral.\" Such a spiral is thought to\noccur if insurers facing higher costs raise premiums, so only\nvery sick people buy coverage, leading to even higher premiums\nwith the pattern continuing until the insurance market either\ndisappears or shrinks to the point that it is not sustainable.The penalty for not buying insurance increases significantly\nby 2016, which should bring in more young and healthy holdouts\nover time.Not everyone, however, is significantly concerned about the\nage of Obamacare enrollees this year.Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute's\nHealth Policy Center, said that Obamacare's protections for\ninsurers in the first few years means the program has time to\nget the demographics sorted out.\"That all combines to make me much less worried about the\nmix for this year,\" Blumberg said. \"I don't think we have to get\na certain percentage of enrollees to be below age 35 or this\nthing crumbles.\""], "2014/01/12/us-syria-crisis-france-idUSBREA0B0IO20140112": ["Friends of Syria group urges opposition to attend Geneva talks", "2014/01/12", "PARIS(Reuters) - The \"Friends of Syria\", an alliance of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries who oppose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, urged opposition groups on Sunday to attend this month's peace talks, saying there was no other route to a political solution.With 10 days to go until the first direct talks between the opposition and President Bashar al-Assad's government - set for January 22 in Switzerland and dubbed \"Geneva 2\" - Western backers have struggled to unify rebel groups.The main political opposition body in exile, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), has been plagued by bickering. It postponed a decision on whether to attend until next week after nearly a quarter of its 121 members threatened to resign after the re-election of its Saudi-backed leader, Ahmad al-Jarba.In a final statement, the 11 core Friends of Syria nations urged the SNC to attend the talks in Montreux, on the shores of Lake Geneva.\"We invite them to form, as soon as possible, a delegation of opposition forces to participate in the political process,\" the joint statement said.\"There is no other political solution,\" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. \"There will be no political solution for Syria unless 'Geneva 2' meets.\"OPPOSITION \"REASSURED\"Jarba, who attended the Paris meeting, did not say whether he believed the Coalition would go, but said he was reassured that the 11 nations had agreed that there could be no transition under Assad.\"We are all in agreement to say that Assad has no future in Syria,\" he said.However, one of Geneva 2's main sponsors is Russia, which has shielded Assad from Western pressure on the U.N. Security Council and rejects the view that his departure is a necessary condition for a settlement.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold meetings in Paris on Monday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N./Arab League envoy for Syria, to prepare for Geneva 2. Lavrov is also due to meet the Coalition and several Arab foreign ministers.Syria plunged into civil war after an uprising against four decades of Assad family rule erupted in March 2011 and descended into an armed insurgency after the army cracked down on protests.Assad's forces have recently been gaining ground against rebel fighters backed by the political opposition groups, and he faces little pressure to make concessions. At the same time, radical Islamists distrusted by the West have taken a bigger role in the campaign to oust him.A Western diplomatic source said the opposition was right to debate whether it should attend Geneva as Damascus refuses to discuss Assad handing over powers.\"The attitude of the regime, which is sending a delegation to do everything but talk of a transition, endangers Geneva, as does the increase in violent bombardments in recent weeks,\" the source said.\"If Russia wants a serious Geneva, it must understand that there cannot be a disconnect between what is happening on the ground and the core diplomatic objective.\"BACKING FOR OPPOSITIONThe source said the Paris talks had aimed to reassure Jarba that the 11 countries backed the opposition wholeheartedly, and that regional nations with links to fighters in Syria would encourage those fighters to support the SNC ahead of Geneva.\"The 11 agree that, whatever the constraints, provocations, refusals by the regime with regard to Geneva, we think it is important they go to Geneva. The illusion that the regime is willing to negotiate has to be broken.\"He acknowledged there was no guarantee the opposition would attend, saying a great deal of work still needed to be done.Western powers have supported the opposition with rhetoric but have backed away from material aid as al Qaeda-linked groups take advantage of a power vacuum in rebel-held regions.In their statement, the Friends of Syria, who include the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, said all armed groups had to respect democratic and pluralistic values, and recognise the political authority of the Coalition.\"Extremist groups play in the favour of the regime, damage the image of the democratic and legitimate Syrian opposition, and deprive them of local and international sympathy and support,\" the statement said.(Reporting by John Irish; Editing byKevin Liffey)"], "2014/01/13/us-tennis-open-venus-idUSBREA0C03N20140113": ["Venus crashes out of first round of Australian Open", "2014/01/13", "MELBOURNE(Reuters) - A promising start to the season for Venus Williams was undone in two-and-a-half hours on Monday as the 33-year-old crashed out of the Australian Open's opening round with a crushing defeat to her sister Serena's 2012 nemesis Ekaterina Makarova.Making her 61st grand slam appearance and 14th at Melbourne Park, the American had arrived Down Under with an encouraging run to the final of the Auckland Classic, raising hopes of a fresh start after recent seasons blighted by injury and illness.On a sunbathed Margaret Court Arena, the former world number one displayed the power and aggression of her halcyon days to roar through the opening set, but it was the uncertain, shaky Venus of recent vintage that ultimately collapsed to a 2-6 6-4 6-4 loss, having taken a 3-0 lead in the third.Williams, who suffers from Sjogren's Syndrome which causes fatigue and joint pain, was hampered by back problems last year but declined to blame health issues for the loss. She could hardly have done so.Throwing herself around the court with the enthusiasm of a teenager, her struggles were largely self-inflicted as she gave up a decisive break in the second set with three successive double-faults and suffered another serving meltdown with victory begging in the third.\"I think obviously I think my error count was a little high,\" Williams told reporters.\"I was hitting the ball well this week, and, you know, obviously it was disappointing to not win the first round.\"I have to give her a lot of credit. She was really determined, and, you know, just kept playing hard. I think any time you're seeded you just really want to win the first round.\"Makarova, who stunned an injured Serena Williams in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open, made a second successive quarter-final appearance at Melbourne Park last year, but largely had her opponent to thank on Monday for her progress to a second round match with American Irina Falconi.\"I think it will be tough. She's 33 now,\" said 25-year-old Makarova of Williams's hopes of becoming a force again at grand slams.\"Sometimes when you are pushing her on her serve, she is making some double faults.\"Still when she's in good form, it's really tough to play against her.\"Williams will team up with her sister Serena to bid for a fifth doubles title at Melbourne Park, and could well have another piece of silverware to fit into a crammed trophy cabinet, but her appearances in grand slam singles draws have become fleeting.Thrashed in straight sets by Maria Sharapova in the third round at Melbourne Park last year, she was dumped from the first round of the French Open and the second at the U.S. Open after pulling out of Wimbledon with a bad back.Asked whether she felt she could close the gap to her best tennis, Williams was also doubtful.\"I don't know. That's difficult to say, because I do play points really well, and then sometimes I don't put them together as well.\"I feel like I have to be patient with myself, because I really haven't had a chance to play that consistently.\"So I think I just have to be patient and keep going and just wait for it to keep coming together more and more.\"(Editing by Peter Rutherford/Greg Stutchbury)"], "2014/01/13/us-autoshow-toyota-fuelcell-idUSBREA0C00X20140113": ["Toyota sees future where others don't in fuel cell technology", "2014/01/13", "TOKYO(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), the global leader in hybrid vehicles, believes that hydrogen fuel cells are a \"viable technology for the foreseeable future\", the head of the Japanese automaker's North American operations said on Sunday.\"I know some of the automotive world have been negative on fuel cell vehicles but other automakers as well as Toyota are moving forward with this technology,\" Jim Lentz said in a speech ahead of the annual North American International Auto Show.Toyota unveiled a fuel cell concept sedan at the Tokyo Motor Show in November.

Expedition 38 crew members captured the Cygnus using the space station's robotic arm at6:08 a.m. Sunday, Jan. 12.Orbital developed its Antares and Cygnus with NASA and successfully completed a test mission to the space station in September, enabling the first of eight planned contract resupply flights by the company. The capsule is scheduled to remain attached to the station through mid-January. It then will return for a destructive reentry in Earth's atmosphere.The International Space Station is a convergence of science, technology and human innovation that demonstrates new technologies and makes research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. The space station has had continuous human occupation sinceNovember 2000. In that time it has been visited by more than 200 people and a variety of international and commercial spacecraft. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in exploration, including future missions to an asteroid and Mars.For more information about the Orbital-1 mission and the International Space Station, visit:http://www.nasa.gov/stationSOURCE  NASA"], "2014/01/13/idUSnMKWr4JHHa+1ce+MKW20140113": [0, "2014/01/13", "Primero Exceeds 2013 Production and Cost Guidance and  Expects a Further 15% Production Increase in 2014(Please note that all dollar amounts in this news release are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.)TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jan 13, 2014) -(Please note that all dollar amounts in this news release are expressed in U.S. dollarsunless otherwise indicated.)Primero Mining Corp. (\"Primero\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:P)(NYSE:PPP) today announced annual production and estimated cash costs for 2013 and provided production and cash cost guidance for 2014 with a three year outlook.Highlights:Record Production in 2013: Fourth quarter production of 34,371 gold equivalent ounces1resulted in record annual 2013 production of 143,114 gold equivalent ounces, 29% higher than 2012 and above the Company's increased guidance range.Low Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs: Estimated annual 2013 cash costs2,4dropped by 6% over 2012 to $599 per gold equivalent ounce, or $389 per gold ounce on a by-product basis; with all-in sustaining costs3,4estimated at $1,072 per ounce.Record Spot Silver Sales: Primero sold 999,162 ounces of silver at spot prices5in 2013, 40% more than 2012.Robust Production Growth in 2014: Production at San Dimas is expected to increase again in 2014 by up to 15% to between 155,000 and 165,000 gold equivalent ounces.Transformational Acquisition Announcement:  The proposed acquisition of Brigus Gold transforms Primero into a diversified, mid-tier gold producer with a three year growth profile that shows a potential 180% increase in production from 2013 to approximately 400,000 gold equivalent ounces, subject to the inclusion of production from Black Fox and Cerro del Gallo by the end of 20166,7.\"In 2013 we continued to focus on delivering strong operating results,\" stated Joseph F. Conway, President and C.E.O. \"And we are very proud of the record results our operating team achieved. Their efforts led to Primero generating significant operating cash flow, despite the depressed commodity price environment. It also allowed us to fund an expansion at San Dimas, advance the Cerro del Gallo development project and positioned us to announce the acquisition of Brigus Gold, which will transform Primero into a diversified, multi-mine, below average cost, Americas based gold producer with 240,000 to 260,000 gold equivalent ounces of production in 2014. Moving forward in 2014 we will continue to focus on delivering strong operating results and optimizing our operating cash flow as we increase San Dimas production by an expected 15%, close the acquisition of Brigus Gold and integrate the Black Fox mine into our portfolio and make a construction decision on the Cerro del Gallo development project.\"Focused on Delivering Strong Operating ResultsPrimero produced 34,371 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter of 2013 (29,097 ounces of gold and 1.60 million ounces of silver). This resulted in record production of 143,114 gold equivalent ounces in 2013 (111,983 ounces of gold and 6.05 million ounces of silver), a 29% increase over 2012 production, exceeding the Company's increased guidance range of 135,000 to 140,000 gold equivalent ounces.Production at San Dimas in 2013 was higher than 2012 as a result of mining more ore at higher grades. Throughput in 2013 increased by approximately 6% over 2012, averaging 2,100 tonnes per day (\"TPD\") (based on 365 day availability). This was mainly due to the success of implementing long-hole mining combined with the Company's mining optimization program. The mining optimization program was also successful at reducing process inefficiencies and improving mining dilution.The Company was also successful at controlling costs, reducing total cash costs for the full year 2013 to an expected $599 per gold equivalent ounce. This is 6% lower than 2012 and below the latest cost guidance range of $620 to $640 per gold equivalent ounce. Cash costs on a by-product bases were $389 per gold ounce, 6% higher than 2012 due to lower realized silver prices. Fourth quarter cash costs are expected to be $660 per gold equivalent ounce, or $550 per gold ounce on a by-product basis. Full year all-in sustaining costs in 2013 are expected to be approximately $1,072 per ounce.Expanded Capacity in 2014In 2014 Primero expects to increase production from San Dimas to between 155,000 and 165,000 gold equivalent ounces, up to 15% higher than 2013, due to operating at the expanded rate of 2,500 TPD by the end of the first quarter.Cash costs for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $575 to $600 per gold equivalent ounce, or between $340 and $360 per gold ounce on a by-product basis. Primero's 2014 outlook is summarized in the following table:Outlook 2014Attributable gold equivalent production1(gold equivalent ounces)155,000-165,000Gold production(ounces)115,000-125,000Silver production5(ounces)6,250,000-6,500,000Total cash costs2,3(per gold equivalent ounce)$575 - $600Total cash costs2,3- by-product(per gold ounce)$340 - $360All-in Sustaining Costs2,3(per gold ounce)$950-$1,050Material assumptions used to forecast total cash costs for 2014 include: an average gold price of $1,200 per ounce; an average silver price of $7.96 per ounce (calculated using the silver purchase agreement contract price5of $4.16 per ounce and assuming excess silver beyond contract requirements is sold at an average silver price of $21 per ounce); and foreign exchange rates of 1.05 Canadian dollars and 13 Mexican pesos to the US dollar.Capital expenditures during 2014 are expected to be approximately $48.7 million excluding capitalized exploration costs of $18.2 million. San Dimas underground development capital and sustaining capital remain at similar levels to 2013, with approximately 69% of 2014 San Dimas capital expenditures allocated to operations and 31% to projects.Capital ExpendituresEstimated 2014San Dimas Underground Development$14.7 millionSan Dimas Sustaining Capital$11.8 millionSan Dimas Waste Rock Pad$3.3 millionSan Dimas Mill Expansion$3.3 millionSan Dimas Hydro Power Expansion and Other Projects$5.2 millionCerro del Gallo$10.4 millionTotal$48.7 millionUnderground development in 2014 will again be focused in the main mining blocks (Central Block and Sinaloa Graben). In 2014 the majority of the ore is anticipated to come from the Central Block with approximately 25% from the higher-grade Sinaloa Graben block.Capital expenditures at Cerro del Gallo are for land acquisition, drilling, engineering and permitting in order to advance the project to a construction decision.Investment in Exploration Proves SuccessfulPrimero continues to invest in exploration at San Dimas as a result of the success achieved over the last two years. In 2013 the Company invested approximately $15 million and again expects to increase reserves and resources beyond depletion when it announces its 2013 year end Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimation before the end of Q1 2014.The Company's exploration strategy since acquiring the San Dimas mine has been to target high grade mineralization in close proximity to existing infrastructure. In 2013, it expanded its exploration program to include regional exploration at San Dimas and the Ventanas property and also commenced exploration at its recently acquired Cerro del Gallo development project. The Company announced the discovery of several new areas of mineralization at San Dimas in 2013. The Company was also successful at reducing its exploration drilling unit cost by more than 20% in 2013, allowing for more metres to be drilled with the original budget.The Company's 2014 $18.2 million exploration program includes a record 94,000 metres of drilling in near mine and regional exploration at San Dimas, regional exploration at Ventanas and near mine and regional exploration at Cerro del Gallo.The San Dimas near mine exploration program includes approximately 35,000 metres of delineation drilling, 25,000 metres of exploration drilling plus 2,500 metres of exploration drifting. The near mine exploration program will focus mainly on reserve and resource development and exploration for the extension of the known underground veins. The majority of the delineation drilling is planned for the Roberta/Robertita and Marina 1/Marina 2 vein systems in the Central Block and the Victoria/Alexa and Elia/Aranza vein systems in the Sinaloa Graben.The San Dimas regional exploration program includes approximately 20,000 metres of drilling and will focus on new discoveries as well as on the surface expressions of the known underground veins.The Ventanas exploration program includes approximately 4,100 metres of drilling on two veins, with systematic channel sampling, and will focus on increasing the existing resource.The Cerro del Gallo exploration program includes approximately 10,000 metres of drilling. Approximately 80% of the 25,269 hectare San Anton property remains unexplored. The Company will also be utilizing new Aster geophysical data and re-interpreting historical airborne magnetic survey data to assess the possibility of further open-pit and/or underground targets in the district. Results of the 2014 exploration program are expected to be an important contributor to a Cerro del Gallo construction decision.Cerro del Gallo Project UpdateDuring 2013 Primero advanced Cerro del Gallo, its 100% owned gold-silver-copper development project in Guanajuato, Mexico. The Company spent approximately $9.4 million of the originally allocated $15 million budget at Cerro del Gallo in 2013. Spending was less than anticipated as a result of delayed land acquisition, less drilling than planned and lower general and administrative expenses than expected.In the fourth quarter of 2013 Primero acquired the outstanding 30.8% interest in Cerro del Gallo from Goldcorp Inc., increased land ownership to approximately 61% of the surface land required for the mine, advanced basic engineering of the mine and the processing facilities, advanced permitting and commenced a preliminary exploration program, including condemnation drilling.During 2013, the Company elected to critically review and refine the capital expenditures for the development of the Cerro del Gallo project as a result of the weaker commodity price environment and the new mining royalties being implemented in Mexico in 2014. The Company now expects a construction decision around mid-2014. If the Company decides to proceed to construction by mid-2014, first production from Cerro del Gallo is still expected by the end of 2015.The Company expects to spend approximately $10.4 million (excluding capitalized exploration of $2.5 million which is included in the Company's estimated exploration expenditures above) in 2014 at Cerro del Gallo in order to advance the project to a construction decision. If a positive construction decision is made, the Company will provide an updated budget for Cerro del Gallo at that time.Brigus Acquisition To Transform Primero into Diversified Mid-Tier ProducerPrimero's proposed acquisition of Brigus Gold Corp. (\"Brigus\"), announced in mid-December 2013, will transform Primero into a diversified, high growth, competitive-cost, Americas based mid-tier gold producer. Primero will become a multi-mine producer with a critical production scale of 240,000 to 260,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2014, a leading organic growth pipeline, and significant exploration upside at all assets6. The combined Company's three year plan forecasts production to increase to around 400,000 gold equivalent ounces by the end of 2016, including production from San Dimas, Black Fox and Cerro del Gallo6,7at below average cash costs.The proposed acquisition is immediately accretive to cash flow and production, increases Primero's reserves and resources and allows entry into a prospective mining district in Canada. The combined Company is expected to appeal to a broader shareholder base, with improved liquidity and an enhanced market capitalization of approximately $720 million6. Brigus shareholders will own approximately 27% of the issued common shares of Primero on a proforma basis.The acquisition delivers on Primero's strategy of expanding in low risk mining friendly jurisdictions of the Americas. With diversified production and cash flow, a strong balance sheet, a superior growth profile and proven operating team, the combined Company creates the potential for a re-rating to a higher valuation multiple more in-line with peers of a similar scale.(1)\"Gold equivalent ounces\" include silver ounces produced, and converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of the average commodity prices realized for each period. The ratio for the fourth quarter 2013 was 304:1 based on the average realized prices of $1,265 per ounce of gold and $4.16 per ounce of silver. The ratio for full year 2013 was 200:1 based on the average realized prices of $1,394 per ounce of gold and $6.97 per ounce of silver. The ratio used for the 2014 guidance projection is 151:1 based on estimated average prices of $1,200 per ounce of gold and $7.96 per ounce of silver.(2)Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce and total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis are non-GAAP measures. Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce are defined as costs of production (including refining costs) divided by the total number of gold equivalent ounces produced. Total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting the by-product silver credits from operating costs and dividing by the total number of gold ounces produced. The Company reports total cash costs on a production basis. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning, and are non-GAAP measures. As such, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. In reporting total cash costs per gold equivalent and total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis, the Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures, prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the Company's Q3 2013 Management Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\") for a reconciliation of cash costs per gold ounce on both a by-product and gold equivalent basis to reported operating expenses (the most directly comparable GAAP measure).(3)The Company, in conjunction with an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry, has adopted an all-in sustaining cost non-GAAP performance measure that the Company believes more fully defines the total cost associated with producing gold; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces produced basis. Refer to the Company's Q3 2013 MD&A for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce.(4)The preliminary cash cost information provided in this news release is approximate and may differ from the final results included in the Company's 2013 annual audited financial statements and MD&A.(5)According to the silver purchase agreement between the Company and Silver Wheaton Corp., until August 6, 2014 Primero will deliver to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 3.5 million ounces of silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.16 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). Thereafter Primero will deliver to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 6.0 million ounces of silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.20 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). The Company will receive silver spot prices only after the annual threshold amount has been delivered.(6)Assuming the acquisition of Brigus Gold Corp. (as announced by the Company on December 16, 2013 in the news release \"Primero to Acquire Brigus Gold and Create a Diversified, Americas Based Mid-Tier Gold Producer\", available on the Company's websitewww.primeromining.comor Sedarwww.sedar.com).(7)Assuming a positive construction decision for Cerro del Gallo is made in 2014 and that production commences at the end of 2015.About PrimeroPrimero Mining Corp. is a Canadian-based precious metals producer that owns 100% of the San Dimas gold-silver mine and 100% of the Cerro del Gallo gold-silver-copper development project in Mexico.

Its \n      discovery has been heralded as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major scientific breakthrough that \n      happens once every decade or so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and represents one of the most \n      promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery \n      today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. \n      RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms \n      ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological \n      process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new \n      class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small \n      interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise \n      Alnylam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by \n      potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing \n      proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat \n      disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.About Alnylam PharmaceuticalsAlnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics \n      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the \n      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core \n      focus on RNAi therapeutics as genetic medicines, including programs as \n      part of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alnylam 5x15TM\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd product strategy. \n      Alnylam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s genetic medicine programs are RNAi therapeutics directed \n      toward genetically defined targets for the treatment of serious, \n      life-threatening diseases with limited treatment options for patients \n      and their caregivers. These include: patisiran (ALN-TTR02), an \n      intravenously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (TTR) \n      for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) in patients with \n      familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP); ALN-TTRsc, a subcutaneously \n      delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR in \n      patients with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC); ALN-AT3, an \n      RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin (AT) for the treatment of \n      hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD); ALN-AS1, an RNAi \n      therapeutic targeting aminolevulinate synthase-1 (ALAS-1) for the \n      treatment of hepatic porphyrias including acute intermittent porphyria \n      (AIP); ALN-CC5, an RNAi therapeutic targeting complement component C5 \n      for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases; ALN-PCS, an RNAi \n      therapeutic targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia; \n      ALN-AAT, an RNAi therapeutic targeting alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) for the \n      treatment of AAT deficiency liver disease; ALN-TMP, an RNAi therapeutic \n      targeting TMPRSS6 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and \n      iron-overload disorders; and ALN-ANG, an RNAi therapeutic for the \n      treatment of genetic forms of mixed hyperlipidemia and severe \n      hypertriglyceridemia, amongst other programs. As part of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alnylam \n      5x15\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy, as updated in early 2014, the company expects to have \n      six to seven genetic medicine product candidates in clinical development \n      - including at least two programs in Phase 3 and five to six programs \n      with human proof of concept - by the end of 2015. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form \n      major alliances with leading companies including Merck, Medtronic, \n      Novartis, Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Cubist, \n      GlaxoSmithKline, Ascletis, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Genzyme, \n      a Sanofi company. In January 2014, Alnylam agreed to acquire Sirna \n      Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. In addition, Alnylam \n      holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused \n      on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA \n      therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their \n      research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers, \n      including many in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top scientific journals such asNature,Nature Medicine,Nature Biotechnology,Cell,theNew \n      England Journal of Medicine,andThe Lancet. Founded in 2002, \n      Alnylam maintains headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Crew Group, Macy's Inc and Williams-Sonoma.Against Newegg, Soverain won in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas but lost at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled that the three online shopping patents were invalid because they were obvious.In its filing to the Supreme Court, Newegg argued that the Federal Circuit decision should be upheld. \"Petitioner's notorious 'shopping cart' patent merely applies the common sense concept of a shopping cart to the Internet,\" Newegg said.Newegg's chief legal officer, Lee Cheng, applauded the decision.\"The witch is dead, hurray,\" he said. \"We are very, very pleased that the Supreme Court has recognized ... these patents should never have been granted in the first place. What we have showed in the Soverain case is the fighting back works.\"Soverain President Katharine Wolanyk said, \"We're obviously disappointed that the court denied our petition,\" said Wolanyk. \"It's a really tough time to be a patent owner.\"There are a variety of bills before Congress aimed at reining in what many tech companies complain is frivolous patent litigation.Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has sponsored legislation aimed at targeting patent assertion entities (PAEs) - companies often known derisively as \"patent trolls\" - which buy or license patents and then extract licensing fees or file infringement lawsuits seen as frivolous.The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in December that would encourage judges to award fees to the winner of an infringement lawsuit if the judge deems the lawsuit unfounded.The White House urged Congress last June to take steps to curb abusive patent lawsuits that have sprung up in recent years, especially in the technology sector.The case is Soverain Software LLC v.

The Chinese\nAscend Mate II? None, at least not yet.In two years, China's three biggest handset makers - Huawei,\nZTE Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd - have\nvaulted into the top ranks of global smartphone charts, helped\nin part by their huge domestic market and spurring talk of a new\nforce in the smartphone wars.Chinese companies took up more showspace at CES than ever\nbefore, eager to tout their products to the world's largest\nelectronics market. Still, analysts said it will likely take\nyears for the Chinese to make headway in the United States,\nwhere arguably the only Asian brand to have succeeded is Samsung\nElectronics Co Ltd.Aside from their struggles to get onto store shelves - U.S.\ncarriers sell nine-tenths of the country's handsets - Chinese\nhandset makers continue to grapple with low brand awareness,\nperceptions of inferior quality, and even security concerns.\"The talk last year was premature,\" said Frank Gillett, an\nanalyst with Forrester Research. \"It's one thing to have the\nproduct. It's another thing to have all the relationships, build\nthe distribution channels and do the marketing.\"We'll maybe start to see things kick in in 2015.\"In the third quarter of last year, ZTE and Huawei accounted\nfor 5.7 percent and 3 percent of all phones sold in the United\nStates, respectively, trailing Apple Inc's 36.2 percent\nand Samsung's 32.5 percent, according to IDC.While Samsung was able to use Google Inc's Android\nsoftware to offer a viable rival to the iPhone, that path now is\ntoo well trodden with many brands offering Android phones.\"It's a tall order to climb into this market and gain\nsignificant share now, simply because they're coming in after\nhabits are established, technology is established and brand\nnames are established,\" Gillett said.THE CHINESE ARE COMINGIt's not for lack of trying. Karen Chupka, one of the\norganizers of CES, said more than 1,800 Chinese companies turned\nup this year. She did not provide a comparison.Huawei and ZTE occupied prominent - and pricey - positions\nat the center of one of the cavernous halls. Huawei said it\ndoubled the size of its booth in two years, and even parked a\nMercedes sedan on the floor to attract participants.For Huawei and ZTE, the push into handsets came amid a\ngeneral slow-down in their bread-and-butter business of selling\nnetworking equipment to telecoms companies.Frustrated by accusations on Capitol Hill that national\nsecurity would be compromised if Chinese networking equipment\nwere installed in the United States, they have sought to double\ndown on handsets for American consumers instead.\"That's a cloud over Huawei's ability to operate here,\" said\nEndpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay. \"Huawei suffers from\nsomething that Lenovo is also smeared with, but Huawei is tarred\neven worse than Lenovo ever was\" in part because of persistent\nreports about its ties to the Chinese military.Compared to many other markets where consumers buy phones at\nfull price for use on pre-paid plans, 92 percent of Americans\nbuy heavily subsidized devices through carriers, IDC says.\"The key to success in the U.S. is the carriers,\" ZTE USA\nPresident Lixin Cheng told Reuters this week in Vegas. He\npointed to a nearby stack of papers. \"That's my schedule.\"\"I'm meeting all the carriers' C-level executives.\"ZTE unveiled late last year the Grand S, an unlocked phone\nthat arrived in the U.S. market to mixed reviews. This week, the\ncompany unveiled a successor device, the Grand S II.Billed as the world's slimmest smartphone, Huawei's Ascend\nP6 debuted to mostly positive reviews last year but was never\npicked up in the United States.T-Mobile said it carries Huawei and ZTE devices, and Sprint\nsaid it sells a ZTE device. But these phones are not easily\nfound in stores nor are they promoted on the carriers' websites.AT&T and Verizon did not respond to requests for comment.THERE'S HOPEStill, some analysts think the Chinese firms may have a\nbetter shot if the U.S. wireless operators change how they sell\nhandsets. T-Mobile made waves last year when it said it would\neliminate contracts for customers who pay full price for phones,\nand its bigger rivals followed suit with similar offers.More changes may be underway: at CES this week, T-Mobile\noffered to pay termination fees for users who switch over,\nessentially offering more freedom to move than before.Huawei and ZTE could make headway if carriers slash\nsubsidies and more consumers are willing to pay full price,\ngiving them an edge over high-end phones. But they may not see\nmeaningful gains for at least two years, said ABI Research\nanalyst Michael Morgan.\"They are already setting themselves up for where the puck\nis going to be tomorrow, when price becomes visible to the\nconsumer again,\" Morgan said. \"There's the crack in the armor\nfor them to sneak through.\"Just as essential is marketing, something Chinese firms have\nless experience with than their foreign rivals. Huawei last year\nuploaded a tongue-in-cheek video of a man asking people around\nNew York's Times Square to pronounce \"Huawei.\" Most failed.And \"ZTE apparently has zero brand presence. No one knows\nwho ZTE is,\" Kay said.In Vegas, Huawei touted figures showing brand recognition\nhas doubled worldwide in the past year. But the least progress\nwas made in the United States and Japan, where its brand\nawareness rose 5 percent and 9 percent, respectively.The Chinese firm has been marketing directly to consumers\nonly in the past three years, sponsoring European sports events\nand music events, such as a recent Jonas Brothers tour.ZTE signed a deal with the Houston Rockets basketball team\nand released a Rockets-branded phone. Yet it will be\nhard-pressed to match Samsung's 2013 marketing budget of $14\nbillion, greater than Iceland's economy.\"Our approach is grassroots, not like many tier-one brand\nnames,\" Cheng said. \"They're burning hundreds of millions of\ndollars of your money - consumer money - to build their brand.\"Some think Lenovo stands the best chance of cracking the\nlocal market, given its longer track record here and a more\nestablished brand in the United States, courtesy of its 2005\nacquisition of IBM's PC division.Lenovo itself expressed an interest in October in Blackberry\n , but the deal was reportedly nixed by Canadian\nregulators. Lenovo USA president Gerry Smith declined to discuss\nspecific deals but said Lenovo will \"continue to look.\"Kevin Restivo, an IDC analyst, said the Chinese contenders\nwere making the right moves but it would take time.\"The Chinese smartphone makers have grown by leaps and\nbounds,\" Restivo said. \"But there's a lot of heavy lifting in\norder for them to approach Samsung as far as status, brand and\nmarket share in the U.S. It's very early days.\""], "2014/01/13/ma-profitect-trackers-idUSnPnNEjwQvW+165+PRN20140113": ["Profitect Mobile Field App Integrates Retailer Social Feedback from Review Trackers", "2014/01/13", "WALTHAM, Mass.,Jan. 13, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2Profitect, a profit amplification solution provider for retail, announces its strategic partnership withReview Trackers, a service-based business for gathering critical consumer-generated data and intelligence.(Logo:http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110712/NE33204LOGO)The partnership, announced at booth #3275 from theNational Retail Federation's \"Big Show\" Annual Convention and Expo 2014 in New York City, combines Profitect's industry leading pattern seeking analytics and Review Trackers' revolutionary online review management and reputation monitoring platform.TheProfitect Mobile Field Application, integrated with Review Trackers industry-leading online review management and reputation monitoring platform, enables retailers to engage and enlist their customers to deliver actionable insights with online communitysocial intelligenceto improve the consumer experience for their brick and mortar stores.\"We're really excited about the partnership with Review Trackers,\" says Guy Yehiav, CEO of Profitect.\u00c2\u00a0 \"For many retailers understanding all of the social channels available and delivering real, measurable business results remain a challenge.

When they see that Obamacare offers high costs for\nlimited access to doctors - if the enrollment goes through at\nall - it's no surprise that young people aren't rushing to sign\nup,\" said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House of Representatives\nSpeaker John Boehner, a Republican.Data released on Monday showed the vast majority of\nenrollees were benefiting from federal subsidies, which can help\npay premiums and out of pocket expenses, not only in the 36\nstates served by the federal government but also in New York -\none of the largest states to operate its own health insurance\nmarketplace.New York state said in its report that the Obamacare plans\navailable to residents are 53 percent less expensive on average\nthan coverage purchased directly from insurers last year.About 30 percent of the 230,624 New Yorkers who enrolled in\na health plan as of Dec. 24, are under the age of 35.New York offered demographic data that the Obama\nadministration has yet to produce, saying that about 44 percent\nof new enrollees were uninsured when they applied for coverage\nwith the largest portion - 62 percent - among those with the\nlowest incomes.\"These enrollment figures are encouraging for this stage in\nthe process, especially with all the early systems problems they\nexperienced,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family\nFoundation. \"We're at half-time in the open enrollment period,\nand I would expect larger numbers of young people to enroll in\nthe second half.\"Senior administration officials said that younger adult\nenrollment surged eight-fold in December when HealthCare.gov was\nworking relatively smoothly for the 36 states it serves. They\nexpect the number to grow strongly in the remaining three months\nas the government ramps up its public outreach campaign.\"The numbers show that there is a very strong national\ndemand for affordable healthcare made possible by the Affordable\nCare Act,\" said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary\nKathleen Sebelius.More than 9 million people have now gained coverage under\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, administration\nofficials estimate.In addition to the private insurance plans, nearly 4 million\npeople have qualified for the Medicaid program for the poor,\nwhile 3 million people in their early 20s are now allowed to\nremain on their parents' plans.The data showed that more women than men (54 percent versus\n46 percent) have signed up for health coverage under Obamacare.About 80 percent of enrollees, both in New York state and in\nthe 36-state federal marketplace also opted for \"silver\" and\n\"bronze\" plans, categories that offer lower premiums but higher\ndeductibles, a development that analysts said could encourage\nmore employers to consider similarly configured plans for their\nworkers down the road.A recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation said\nhaving younger adults make up only 25 percent of enrollees would\npresent a \"worst case\" scenario. They found that costs then\nwould be about 2.4 percent higher, but insurers would retain a\nvery slim profit margin.As a result, the Kaiser authors projected the companies\nwould raise premiums by a commensurate amount, but not enough to\ndestabilize the market. \n\n (Additional reporting bySharon Begley, Susan Cornwell and\nRoberta Rampton; editing byMichele GershbergandSandra Maler)"], "2014/01/13/banks-commodities-fed-idUSL2N0KN2DE20140113": ["UPDATE 1-U.S. Fed set to push ahead on new commodity trade rules", "2014/01/13", "ByAnna Louie SussmanandEmily StephensonNEW YORK/WASHINGTONJan 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal\nReserve is set to take its first formal step toward limiting the\nrole of Wall Street banks in physical commodities markets this\nweek by issuing a notice to seek public comment on the topic,\nsources familiar with the matter said on Monday.The Fed will publish an \"advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking\" on Tuesday, laying out the issues it is considering,\none day before a second Senate banking committee hearing on the\nmatter, the sources said.The notice and Wednesday's hearing will provide the first\nglimpse into the Fed's response to growing public and political\noutcry over the risks of allowing banks to trade physical\ncommodities such as tankers of crude oil and pallets of copper.It is not clear what measures the Fed may propose. The\npublic is expected to have 60 to 90 days to submit comment\nletters, which the Fed can use to formulate its rules.A Federal Reserve spokeswoman declined to comment.Over the past year, lawmakers have pressed the Fed to\nexamine whether Wall Street's biggest banks, including JPMorgan\nChase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, should be\nallowed to own assets such as metals warehouses and oil tankers,\nand to trade physical commodities alongside commodity\nderivatives.At a Senate hearing in July, witnesses testified that the\nactivities pose a risk to the financial system in the event of a\ncatastrophic accident. Metals consumers complained that banks'\nownership of physical storage assets enabled them to inflate\nprices for commodities such as aluminum.The notice by the Fed may touch on the issue of capital\nsurcharges for certain activities, an issue that arose in media\nreports but was never clarified by the Fed.SOME BANKS EXITING COMMODITIESIn July, the Fed said it would be reviewing the role of\nbanks in physical commodities trading, something that it has\nallowed a range of banks to engage in since 2003.Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics in\nWashington said the notice would likely seek comment on how the\nrisk varies by commodity, and would consider the systemic impact\nof various physical trading activities.\"This is hard, and the Fed is busy,\" Petrou said. \"It is\nreally complicated. If you want to have a simple capital rule,\nthen you would have an across-the-board charge for certain\ncommodities activities, but it's true that some of them are a\nlot riskier than others.\"It is unclear whether the Fed will also address a related\nbut distinct question: whether former investment banks Goldman\nand Morgan Stanley should be allowed to carry on owning\ncommodity-related assets, such as metals warehouses and oil\npipeline, due to a \"grandfathering\" clause in a 1999 law.Regardless of the scope of the Fed's statements, they are\ncertain to be scrutinized by industry executives and their\nlawyers, who have been frustrated by the lack of clarity over a\npossible crack-down that could further roil Wall Street's\nmultibillion-dollar trading operations.Some banks have not waited for a final word. JPMorgan is in\nthe final stage of a months-long process to sell its entire\nphysical commodity desk, and Morgan Stanley agreed last month to\nsell its physical oil trading operation to Rosneft.\"One thing I'd want to look at is their justifications for\nsuch a proposal. I think for it to be an appropriately reasoned\nrule-making, it should address how the charges address the\nrisks,\" said a banking lawyer who declined to be named.\"I would also want to see what they said about their\nsupervisory experience over the time they have allowed financial\ncompanies to do this.\""], "2014/01/13/ut-wdb-funding-idUSnBw135044a+100+BSW20140113": ["Former First Franklin CEO Andrew Pollock Joins National Private Money Lender", "2014/01/13", "Former First Franklin CEO Andrew Pollock Joins National Private Money \n      LenderWDB Funding Taps Industry Heavy Hitter To Lead Expansion EffortsWDB Funding, LLC is proud to announce the appointment of Andrew Pollock \n      as the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President and Chief Executive officer.

(NYSE MKT:UUUU)(TSX:EFR) (\"Energy Fuels\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Graham G. Moylan has advised the Company that he will be resigning from his position as Chief Financial Officer effective February 15, 2014, in order to pursue an investment banking opportunity in Toronto. Daniel G. Zang, CPA, the Company's Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer will assume the role of interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company upon Mr. Moylan's departure. Mr. Moylan was appointed the Company's Chief Financial Officer in September 2012, after having spent approximately 7 years in the investment banking industry and acted as the Company's primary investment banker from March 2011 until joining as the Company's CFO.Mr. Moylan stated, \"I am very proud of what my colleagues and I have accomplished over the past few years at Energy Fuels. Notwithstanding the challenges Fukushima posed for the uranium industry and its negative impact on the commodity price and valuations within the sector, Energy Fuels has executed an impressive growth strategy. This growth strategy saw the Company progress from being a relatively small uranium developer to a large domestic uranium producer in the U.S. with extensive holdings of uranium resources and substantial development projects. The Company also raised over $50 million in financing and obtained a listing on a recognized US stock exchange during this time. I would like to thank Stephen Antony and the Board of Directors for providing me with this great opportunity.\"Mr. Zang has many years of experience as Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and other positions with a number of public and private companies, including Controller and Treasurer of General Moly, Inc. and Vice President and Controller of Cyprus Copper Company, an operating division of Cyprus Minerals Company that earned annual revenues in excess of US$1 billion.Stephen Antony, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer stated, \"Dan Zang, who will be stepping in as interim Chief Financial Officer, has a wealth of experience in senior financial positions with mining and other companies, including in the role of Chief Financial Officer for a public company. Mr. Zang's years of experience in mining operations will benefit the Company as it develops and operates its portfolio of assets during the expected recovery in uranium markets. Mr. Moylan has been instrumental in the Company's growth and development over the last two years, having played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Strathmore Minerals Corp. and other strategic and financial initiatives. We see Graham's new position as an exceptional opportunity, which will also allow Graham to continue to provide financial advice and assistance to the Company as needed, and wish him all the success in the future.\"About Energy Fuels: Energy Fuels is currently America's largest conventional uranium producer, supplying approximately 25% of the uranium produced in the United States. Energy Fuels operates the White Mesa Mill, which is the only conventional uranium mill currently operating in the U.S. The mill is capable of processing 2,000 tons per day of uranium ore and has a licensed capacity of over 8 million lbs. of U3O8per year. Energy Fuels has projects located throughout the Western U.S., including producing mines and mineral properties in various stages of permitting and development.

Maybe a localized ceasefire, beginning with Aleppo,\" Syria's largest city. \"And both of us have agreed to try to work to see if that could be achieved.\"Syrian rebels backed by Washington have agreed that, if the government commits to such a partial ceasefire, \"they would live up to it\", Kerry said.Given the history of failed attempts to end the war, which has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions, it remains far from clear that even a partial ceasefire can be achieved or, if it is, can hold.It also seems unlikely to be honored by powerful militant islamist rebel factions, some of whom are at war with both Damascus and other rebel groups backed by the West and Gulf states.But diplomats are trying to persuade the combatants to agree to a series of steps to improve the atmosphere for Syrian peace talks planned for Switzerland on January 22.Kerry spoke at a press conference in Paris with Lavrov and Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. Secretary General's top Syria envoy.Lavrov, whose government backs Assad, said the Syrian government had indicated it might provide access for humanitarian aid to reach besieged areas. He specifically cited the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta, where 160,000 people have been largely trapped by fighting, according to the United Nations.\"We await similar steps by the opposition,\" Lavrov said.Kerry expressed some skepticism that Assad's government would follow through.\"The proof will be in the pudding, as we say,\" he said. \"This news of a possibility is welcome.\"Kerry said he and Lavrov had also discussed a possible exchange of prisoners between the sides.The opposition is ready to put together a list of prisoners and \"are prepared to entertain such an exchange\", he said.DIVISIONS OVER IRANBut Russia and the United States remained sharply divided over whether Iran, which is a major player in the Syria conflict, should attend the peace talks, which will convene in Montreux, on the shores of Lake Geneva.\"I'm convinced that practicality and pragmatism ... require that Iran should be invited,\" Lavrov said.Other countries have already been invited \"who do not want the conference to succeed\", he said, in apparent reference to Gulf Arab countries who are arming rebel groups.Brahimi has also argued that Iran should attend the planned talks. Discussions on the matter are continuing, he said on Monday.But Kerry reiterated the U.S. view that Iranian delegates should come only if they are willing to accept an agreement reached at a June 2012 peace conference in Geneva that calls for a transitional government body to be established in Damascus \"by mutual consent\".The United States interprets that language as requiring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's departure from power; Russia disagrees.\"Iran's participation or non-participation is not a question of ideology. It is a question of practicality and common sense,\" Kerry said.\"I invite Iran today to join the community of nations, the 30 nations that are already prepared to come, and be a constructive partner for peace,\" he said. \"That's the invitation.\"The main Syrian opposition group backed by the West has said it will decide on Friday whether to attend the peace conference, known as Geneva 2.\"If we want to end this war, there is no other solution than to talk. Talk means negotiate. That's the objective of Geneva 2,\" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told BFM-TV.\"We hope Geneva 2 takes place, but it's not set yet. Bashar (al-Assad) and the terrorists are doing the utmost to prevent negotiations.\"(Additional reporting by Alexandria Sage. Editing by Ralph Boulton)"]}

They embody a radical new approach to orchestral virtuosity as well as to score fidelity, vocal style and performance practice.Figarowas recorded over 11 straight days and nights for up to 14 hours per day.\u00c2- Sony Classicalto launch the series withLe Nozze di Figaroon March 25th2014, followed byCosi fan tuttein Autumn 2014, andDon Giovannito complete the cycle in Autumn 2015.\u00c2Almost one thousand miles east ofMoscow, in the Russian city of Perm, the charismatic and provocative conductorTeodor CurrentzisandMusicAeterna, the orchestra and choir he created, are recording Mozart's Da Ponte operas. These no-compromise studio recordings are the fruit of a unique way of living and working which Currentzis has established in this remote, formerly closed city, which was dedicated to arms manufacturing in Soviet times.In 2011, when invited meet the Artistic Director at Perm's opera house, Currentzis negotiated unheard-of conditions: unlimited rehearsal time; the freedom to schedule performances depending on the quality reached in rehearsals; and finally, the resources to explore with his musicians anything deemed necessary for a fuller understanding of the repertoire, from Baroque dance steps to 20th-century poetry and avant-garde cinema.The orchestra and choir emphatically embrace a non-establishment attitude, constantly putting themselves in question and striving for perfection. As important as their musical prowess (many members are laureates of international competitions) is their willingness to undergo exceptional rigors to reach the shared artistic goals.Figarowas recorded in sessions of up to fourteen hours over eleven straight days and nights. It is an accepted part of these musicians' daily routine to spend a whole night of work and discussion about its progress at the opera house if necessary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or to devote a full rehearsal to shapingone singlechord to perfection. Currentzis has tried to create an environment for those who search for what he calls \"a real life in music.\" Since the founding of MusicAeterna, Currentzis and the ensemble have been awarded 4 Golden Masks \u00e2\u20ac\u201cRussia'stop performing arts award.Born inAthensin 1972, Teodor Currentzis moved toSt. Petersburgin 1994 to study conducting with legendary teacherIlya Musin, who has, among others, also trained Valery Gergiev andSemyon Bychkov. While music director of theNovosibirskopera from 2004, Currentzis founded MusicAeterna. After making headlines with various productions, including the controversial so-calledChechnya Aidadirected byDmitry Tcherniakov, Currentzis soon gained recognition beyond the Russian scene. One ofGermany'sleading newspapers, the Suddeutsche Zeitung, recently described Currentzis as \"a hugely talented individual who has proven a sensation on the international stage...\u00c2\u00a0Everything about him exudes power and intensity.\"Peter Culshaw, writing in the London Telegraph, said: \"Currentzis could be one of those rare artists capable of shifting the ground of his chosen art, and pulling off something extraordinary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0 perhaps even miraculous.\"Currentzis' approach to the Mozart scores is based on the conviction that it is virtually impossible today to hear them performed precisely and in full. His stated intention is to undo what he considers the effects of 20th-century operatic tradition focused on simplification and vocal volume at all cost. For Currentzis, these recordings represent the culmination of a decade-long research project dedicated to the discrepancies between the composer's will and what our ears have become used to. About hisFigaro, he says:\"The radicality of this recording is its precision. It is through strictest discipline that you unlock the perfume, bring the composer's text into real life, create all these colours that are impossible on the stage. This is why we spent such a significant amount of time in the studio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because we were pushing to reach our limits, to jump above our limit and reach a new understanding of this music. That is the privilege of a no-compromise studio recording. There are so many recordings which convey the general spirit of Mozart's music. The only point in making a new one is to give the audience a chance to hear and learn about all the magic which this score holds. I made this recording because I wanted to show what can be achieved if you avoid the factory approach of the classical-music mainstream. My credo is that every performance you give has to be like a pregnancy. You have to dream and you have to wait until the time comes when you see the miracle happening. If you're not like that in music, you lose the central idea of music. Music is not a profession and it's not about reproduction. It's a mission.\"Currentzis' rigorous approach extends to all stages of the recording set-up as well as to the post-production sequence. The editing and mixing ofFigaroinPariswas a process of several weeks in which every single decision was made and its execution supervised by the conductor. Currentzis, a diehard devotee of high-end audio equipment, took particular care in the shaping of the overall soundscape for these recordings.While period instruments are being used in this cycle, no dogmatic \"authentic performance\" claim is made. Currentzis chooses the orchestra's instruments depending on repertoire. For the Da Ponte cycle, historic instruments were chosen because, as Currentzis explains:\"They give me the vibrancy, the speed, the taut, tight, crisp sound which fully delivers the thrill of this music. I use them because they sound better. If I thought this music sounded better on electric guitars, I would perform it on electric guitars.\"The soloists' vocal technique is also markedly different to modern operatic interpretation, with a focus on intimacy and clarity, a use of vibrato remarkably restrictive even by today's \"period practice\" standards as well as an approach to melodic ornamentation derived from historical sources which cannot be heard in other performances of these works.In 2012 Sony Classical signed an exclusive long-term agreement with Currentzis under which all of his recordings will be made with MusicAeterna. The first two opera recordings, already finished, were Mozart'sFigaroandCosi.Don Giovanniwill be recorded inOctober 2014.The lead soloists appearing inLe Nozze di FigaroareAndrei Bondarenkoas Count Almaviva,Simone Kermesas Countess Almaviva,Christian Van Hornas Figaro andFanie Antonelouas Susanna.

Where is it?\"According to the report, Weber said the response was delayed when the ambulance arrived at the mall but was unable to fit under the parking deck's ceiling. The crew had to push a stretcher up an entrance ramp to Friedland's body, he said.Weber also told the newspaper that it was not clear whether the responding ambulance was coming from the Millburn-Short Hills Volunteer First Aid squad's headquarters 4 miles from the mall or from a different location.When contacted by Reuters, the ambulance company declined to comment about the incident, including a request on typical response times in the area.After the shooting, the suspects drove away in the victim's car, which was later found in Newark.

Just getting to the start line at the Sanki Sliding Centre in Sochi will represent a triumph in spite of adversity.Farrow's battle to overcome a career-threatening injury is no ordinary tale - and he still has the physical and mental scars to prove it.The former downhill mountain biker racer broke both his collar bones while hurtling down slopes on two wheels and has metal screws in his back and shoulder blades as a constant reminder.But that was nothing compared to the moment his ankle rolled, he buckled and fell awkwardly during sprint training on a running track two days before the start of the World Cup skeleton season in Lake Placid in 2011.He damaged his left leg so badly that he ruptured his ACL, LCL, hamstring, popliteal tendon, broke his tibia and did peroneal nerve damage.\"We don't know why it happened. I was just unlucky. I felt like my leg had snapped in half. I didn't want to look down,\" he told Reuters.\"I was in so much pain I instantly thought that was it, career over. While I was lying injured the question I asked myself was 'what are you going to do now?'... and I didn't have an answer.\"And because I didn't, I made a clear decision right there that skeleton was what I wanted to do.\"The long road back through rehabilitation to competition has included two operations and organ donations of a hamstring and an Achilles tendon.The healing process is ongoing with some feeling returning in his foot although the nerve damage may never fully recover.At one stage numb from his knee down to his big toe, the feeling has recovered to the point where the movement is limited between toe and ankle.The mental scars will always be there though.\"The memory of that day will never fade,\" he said.\"I'm still nowhere near fully recovered yet. The physical (scars) are still there but the mental side of it... it's something I don't think I'll ever get out of my mind. Every time I'm doing sprints I remember what happened.\"PRETTY FLAWLESSHandicapped at the sprint start when racers try to gain those vital fractions of a second advantage, Farrow has to make up time on the descent to be competitive.\"I do the best I can at the start. I'm not even going to try and compare myself to the other guys because they are going to beat me all the time. I find when I focus on the start I get quite down about it,\" he said.\"But what I can do is drive the sled - having speed at the top is an advantage but if you make no mistakes on the way down you can make that time back.\"For me to be able to compete and keep up with these guys I've got to be flawless on the track pretty much because I don't have that momentum at the top to lose. If I make a mistake in the first or second corner, I'm done.\"He began the season by finishing 20th in Calgary, followed up with 24th in Utah and in the last race of this year, was 22nd in Lake Placid.Farrow is realistic and knows he is not yet ready to challenge the sport's top dogs - the likes of Latvian Martins Dukurs and Russian Alexander Tretiakov - but is looking to the long term and the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\"Right now I'm focusing on the best I can be. If I do make Sochi, and I think I have a great chance, it will be a huge thing to come back from this injury and to have this paralysed foot for so long.\"I've still got another four years in me. It's always been a race against the clock. I'm trying to get my start as fast as it can but it's a little bit out of my range to be competing (now) at the top level in the start.\"Farrow missed out on 2010 Olympics after his re-allocation spot was removed a few days before the start of the Games when governing body FIBT decided to cut the criteria back to 28 athletes.\"It was really gutting. I was close to qualifying and didn't, then a couple of days later I was given a re-allocation spot. Then they decided to just have 28... it was a bit of a rollercoaster.

Richter spokeswoman Zsuzsa Beke told Reuters on Tuesday in response to a question.\"We believe that Forest does not intend to make a hostile takeover, this is entirely unrealistic,\" she said.Forest

That stake serves in part to prevent any hostile takeover attempts, Richter's chief executive Erik Bogsch has said.Richter shares rose 3.5 percent in Monday trade on the Budapest Stock Exchange, outperforming the wider market. The shares were down 1.3 percent at 4,695 forints ($21.47) by 0925 GMT on Tuesday.Some market players said Monday's gains may have been fuelled by recent takeover activity by Forest.\"The company announced its purchase of Aptalis last week and flagged further acquisitions, which led many to consider Richter as a target,\" analysts at brokerage Equilor said.Forest said last week it would buy speciality pharmaceutical maker Aptalis from private equity firm TPG Capital for $2.9 billion (\u00c2\u00a31.76 billion) in a deal it promised would increase next year's earnings.Analysts at Erste Bank have said gains in Richter shares over the past week were also fuelled by expansion prospects flagged by its chief executive to Reuters in an interview.(Reporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing byMark Potter)"], "2014/01/14/idUSnMKWc9L81a+1c8+MKW20140114": ["St. Pete Beach Corey Area Craft Festival Slated for January 18 - 19, 2014", "2014/01/14", "St. Pete Beach Corey Area Craft Festival Slated for January 18 - 19, 2014ST.

With successful drill results of 2013 the Company believes that the Project may have the potential of hosting significant silver dominated polymetallic resources, and the Company plans to commence resource definition drilling at the known mineralized Zone 1 and Zone 2, and, in addition, plans to continue with regional exploration to identify more mineralized zones at other prospects of the Project during the 2014 field campaign.Table 1: Assay resultsHole_idDepth_from(m)Depth_to(m)Inter-val(m)Ag_g/tPb_%Zn_%Sb_%Cu_%SnO2_%RemarksZK240217.0018.501.500.650.01Zone 126.0061.3035.303434.134.660.600.120.14including27.3335.207.871,21913.6311.861.690.380.44106.30107.301.001660.440.400.220.03178.40180.151.75150.290.390.040.01241.50243.001.50130.480.870.010.01283.50286.503.0030.070.910.010.00289.50291.001.5060.021.210.01294.00295.801.80160.200.790.030.010.01ZK160217.0024.507.5010.130.870.010.0148.5050.001.50580.350.130.050.03110.65127.0016.352041.533.150.370.040.02including110.65117.807.154122.695.480.710.080.04149.55157.007.45330.600.790.110.02163.00164.501.5060.050.460.010.01168.90170.351.45130.220.690.030.01186.70188.201.50131.510.020.160.01ZK270121.9023.401.50250.300.670.070.020.0169.2471.802.56360.671.530.110.020.0177.8079.301.50170.250.560.040.010.0180.4086.706.302715.613.100.840.100.13including82.6583.450.801,74038.5213.205.630.510.6588.0089.301.30300.590.360.070.0191.9093.051.15150.240.640.030.010.03162.10166.654.55771.230.920.020.040.04including164.60165.601.002614.121.460.030.120.10170.80176.455.651351.635.790.040.100.05including170.80173.602.802593.257.250.080.150.08ZK190116.5517.300.75580.440.530.150.020.0136.2037.501.30450.410.760.100.0144.5050.405.90591.022.870.210.030.02including46.3547.851.501522.527.720.590.070.0676.6379.803.171132.802.230.510.040.02including76.6377.901.272466.274.661.150.080.0585.9587.201.25300.740.590.090.01192.52194.552.03220.250.290.030.01ZK110143.8045.301.50290.530.900.060.0272.0073.201.20170.270.990.050.03101.00102.151.152643.272.560.090.070.03249.25250.501.25190.022.080.040.03ZK00370.5071.901.401390.810.530.640.03219.30220.501.20160.230.460.01234.45237.553.10280.400.610.050.020.01238.80240.001.20400.130.440.030.01376.00377.501.5080.090.450.020.01380.50385.004.50340.220.730.020.03ZK5015.906.901.00793.292.890.600.050.0451.7053.101.40611.681.200.460.040.05106.90108.601.701500.260.360.340.040.04263.70265.201.50210.330.520.020.01ZK80127.2028.701.50560.801.800.150.040.0537.7040.102.40180.270.710.040.0148.8051.002.20120.150.890.050.0160.7061.701.00550.290.100.080.020.01ZK320166.9070.904.002090.510.840.180.04including69.5070.901.404401.232.070.440.060.0192.0097.005.00690.151.270.070.020.01141.00142.101.10220.290.510.030.020.01143.20144.251.051211.125.450.360.080.06201.70205.053.35530.581.480.020.01ZK40016.507.701.2050.080.760.010.0233.3534.200.851570.372.270.110.0438.6042.303.70330.090.780.030.0158.7059.801.1060.100.680.020.010.01118.00119.201.202141.354.950.270.050.01ZK3505199.30213.5014.20450.690.980.080.030.03ZK70147.8749.151.28491.316.210.440.050.05Zone 254.9056.401.5040.010.560.010.0160.5062.051.55150.102.200.030.020.01TC11015.508.102.6059810.610.753.020.050.15ZK110263.5065.001.501050.300.240.170.0189.00104.0015.002765.006.131.190.080.07including91.2595.003.7560210.8710.702.630.140.12including99.65102.602.954388.9810.451.530.140.14ZK1103203.60206.102.50410.821.490.070.020.01210.90212.201.30240.260.440.040.01ZK150193.8099.405.604061.440.961.020.02including93.8095.301.505020.871.160.550.03including96.6098.001.408902.940.292.580.04Drill cores were halved by diamond saw with half core samples being shipped to the laboratory of ALS at Guangzhou for preparation and analysis.

The findings from this work show ST2 can assist \n      in differentiating the three prognostic patterns of uncomplicated HT \n      from two of its major cardiac complications and may also become useful \n      in the choice of specific antihypertensive agents. The authors note, \"As \n      it is well known that LVH often\u00c2\u00a0progresses to heart failure,\u00c2\u00a0early \n      diagnosis of hypertensive LVH\u00c2\u00a0and its treatment with \n      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\u00c2\u00a0(ACE inhibitors) and \n      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) will therefore, in no small \n      [way],\u00c2\u00a0reduce the burden of HHF, which is the commonest form of \n      heart\u00c2\u00a0failure in our environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe study also looked at another popular biomarker, NT-proBNP. Results \n      showed quite conclusively that ST2 was superior to NT-proBNP in \n      differentiating hypertension from hypertensive heart failure and was \n      also better at distinguishing hypertensive LVH from hypertensive heart \n      failure.This prospective in-hospital and out-patient study involved just over \n      200 subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension and hypertensive heart \n      failure from sub-Saharan Africa, in this case, Nigeria. Black population \n      groups tend to develop high blood pressure at younger ages than other \n      groups and are more likely to develop complications associated with high \n      blood pressure.Left ventricular hypertrophy results in response to some factor, such as \n      high blood pressure, that requires the left ventricle to work hard, and \n      to compensate, the walls of the heart thicken and lose elasticity. There \n      is widespread agreement that LVH is an important intermediate phenotype \n      in the progression of hypertensive heart disease.2Study investigators also found an association between ST2 and LV \n      ejection fraction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As LV ejection is a strong prognostic factor in \n      heart failure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd state the authors, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our data therefore suggest that \n      plasma ST2 could be a good prognostic marker of heart failure in \n      hypertensive subjects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdMoreover, a strong link between ST2 and echocardiographic LV diastolic \n      function was shown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, plasma ST2 is not only correlated with \n      systolic function but also with diastolic function in a cohort of our \n      hypertensive subjects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remark the authors, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the other hand, \n      there was no significant correlation between NT-proBNP and all indices \n      of diastolic function assessed in our study cohort, similar to previous \n      studies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This study builds on the strong body of evidence we already have \n      showing the powerful predictive value of ST2,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd declares David M. \n      Geliebter, CEO of Critical Diagnostics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly interesting \n      is how the investigators identified this subset of patients likely to \n      advance to heart failure or a worsening stage of heart failure, because \n      we know that in half the patients that advance to Stage C, cost of care \n      rises dramatically and 5-year survival rates fall quite precipitously. \n      So having a biomarker that can help health care professionals refine the \n      discrimination within hypertensive patients and those in early stages of \n      heart failure and then treat them accordingly, can save and improve \n      lives and, at the same time, reduce the burden to the healthcare system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdAbout ST2ST2 is a soluble protein expressed by the heart in response to disease \n      or injury. It is reflective of ventricular remodeling and cardiac \n      fibrosis associated with heart failure. ST2 is not adversely affected by \n      confounding factors such as age, body mass index and impaired renal \n      function. Unlike many other cardiac biomarkers, ST2 levels change \n      quickly in response to changes in the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condition\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthus helping \n      physicians make informed decisions on an appropriate course of action to \n      take and, if needed, to quickly adjust treatment. All this makes ST2 an \n      ideal serial biomarker for monitoring and treating heart failure \n      patients.The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline For The Management of Heart Failure, \n      recognizes ST2 as\u00e2\u20ac\u0153not only predictive of hospitalization and death \n      in patients with HF but also additive to natriuretic peptide levels in \n      [its] prognostic value.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe Presage\u00c2\u00ae ST2 Assay from Critical Diagnostics is the only \n      commercially available ST2 biomarker test in the world. The Presage ST2 \n      Assay has been CE Marked and cleared by the U.S. FDA for use as in the \n      risk stratification of chronic heart failure patients.About Critical DiagnosticsFounded in 2004, Critical Diagnostics (www.criticaldiagnostics.com) \n      develops novel biomarkers to help physicians optimize patient care in \n      cardiovascular diseases, while containing healthcare costs.

Earnings ticked up slightly, buoyed by both modest \n      revenue growth and controlled expenses, resulting in a solid return on \n      average assets (ROA) of 1.47%. Fitch views the results favorably as WFC \n      appears to have been able to react nimbly to the changing mortgage \n      refinancing market. WFC's credit profile also benefits from continuing \n      improvement in asset quality, and unlike some of its large bank peers, \n      WFC has reported relatively manageable litigation-related charges to \n      date.Revenues were up slightly (1%) on both higher spread income and improved \n      noninterest income. WFC reported decent sequential loan growth with \n      loans increasing 7% on an annualized basis from the prior quarter, with \n      broad-based growth across many asset classes. Fitch expects this level \n      of loan growth will surpass peer averages. The net interest margin (NIM) \n      continued to contract a further 12bps in 4Q'13, reflecting both deposit \n      growth and liquidity-related actions taken last quarter by WFC.Mortgage results were relatively resilient in 4Q'13. While mortgage \n      originations declined by nearly 40%, mortgage banking noninterest income \n      fell only 2% from the prior quarter. Servicing income increased by \n      roughly 40% due primarily to a write-up in the valuation of the mortgage \n      servicing rights (MSR) asset in light of higher mortgage interest rates. \n      Offsetting this, gain on sale revenue fell 22%, reflecting lower \n      origination volumes. Offsetting the decline in mortgage revenues, WFC \n      reported stronger trust and investment fees, up 6% on a linked-quarter \n      basis.Expenses were flat sequentially. Lower staffing costs in mortgage were \n      offset by higher equipment expenses reflecting annual license renewals. \n      WFC also reported higher outside professional services expenses related \n      to compliance and regulatory-related initiatives.WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $600 \n      million as compared to $900 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) \n      remained very manageable at just 47bps of average loans during the \n      quarter supported by lower consumer losses. Provision expenses increased \n      to $363 million during the quarter, up from just $75 million last \n      quarter, marking the first increase in quarterly provision expenses for \n      the year.WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration \n      in economic conditions. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are likely \n      not sustainable, with historical losses more around the 100bps range.As previously disclosed, WFC has now reached agreements with both Fannie \n      Mae and Freddie Mac resolving substantially all repurchase liabilities \n      related to loans sold prior to Jan. 1, 2009.

Veugelers said.He worked on the study at the University of Alberta's School of Public Health in Edmonton.School programs aimed at improving fitness and reducing obesity have produced mixed results. No program had been proven to meaningfully affect how much children exercise outside of school hours, the researchers noted.They organized an intervention targeted toward elementary schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Edmonton. The program was implemented in 10 schools in the beginning of 2008 and continued through the 2010-2011 school year.The researchers assessed the needs of each school and designed activities to get kids moving based on those needs. Some schools had activity groups designed especially for girls, for instance, and others hosted yoga or dance classes to get less-competitive students exercising. Each school also had a full-time health facilitator to teach classes and organize activities.To see how much kids at those schools were actually exercising, Veugelers and his colleagues asked approximately 200 fifth-graders to wear a pedometer for one week in 2009 and another 200 to begin wearing the device in 2011, further into the program.For comparison, they also had fifth-graders at 20 schools where the program wasn't implemented wear pedometers at the same time. Children at those schools generally came from wealthier families and fewer of them were overweight.Students from both groups of schools upped their physical activity during the two-year period. But gains were bigger at schools that had implemented the health program. Children's average daily steps during a typical week increased by 21 percent - from about 10,700 to 13,000 steps - at those schools.At comparison schools, children increased their physical activity by 7 percent - from 12,300 to 13,100 steps per day.Improvements were seen on both weekdays and weekends, the researchers wrote Monday in Pediatrics.\"One of the big strengths of this study is they objectively measured how much physical activity improved,\" Dr. Kevin C. Harris said. A pediatric cardiologist at BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada, Harris has studied school physical activity programs but wasn't involved in the new research.\"It's very encouraging that this actually increased the level of physical activity,\" he told Reuters Health.\"The success of the program comes really from connecting everybody,\" including school staff, teachers, parents and students, Veugelers said.One downside of the intervention, he said, is that it's \"not an inexpensive program.\" The upside is that it seems to work even in poorer, more challenging schools.\"These were not the easiest schools,\" Veugelers told Reuters Health. \"If we can deliver it in those schools, I think we can deliver it in other schools.\"SOURCE:bit.ly/1hmS7g4Pediatrics, online January 13, 2014."], "2014/01/14/idUSnCCNbqqXrH+1c5+MKW20140114": [0, "2014/01/14", "Update on Macarthur Minerals' Iron Ore ProjectsVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jan. 14, 2014) -Macarthur Minerals Limited (TSX:MMS)(OTCQX:MMSDF)(the \"Company\" or \"Macarthur\")\u00c2\u00a0is pleased to provide an update on the Company's iron ore projects and plans for 2014.Major Achievements during 2013Ularring Hematite ProjectThe Company's immediate focus remains to bring the Ularring Hematite Project (\"Project\") in Western Australia into production by Q3/Q4 2015.METALLURGICAL TEST WORK IDENTIFIES DISTINCT ZONES FOR SELECTIVE MININGFurther metallurgical testing and iron ore characterisation work was undertaken during 2013.There are a number of zones within the ore body, including zones of predominantly haematitic ores and zones of predominantly geothitic ores. The response to grinding, gravity separation and magnetic separation depends on the specific mineral assemblage, with some ore types possibly beneficiable using a simplified process flow sheet.If confirmed by test work presently under way, this may provide for an opportunity to approach the development of the ore body in stages, with selective mining providing readily beneficiable ore to a simplified beneficiation plant in the first stage to be followed by mining and processing of the remainder of the resource utilising a more complex beneficiation plant at a later date.Such an approach, if technically feasible, could have a positive impact on reducing the Project's initial capex and opex costs. The relevant metallurgical test work is under way and evaluation of this approach is the current focus of the Company's metallurgical consulting team.OPTIMISATION OF THE 2012 PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY STUDY OPEX & CAPEXThroughout 2013, the Company optimised the inputs to the Project's Preliminary Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") that was published in September 2012 (news release dated August 16, 2012, NI43-101 Technical Report dated September 27, 2012). This follows a successful Expression of Interest Program (\"EOI\") for contractors offering core mining, processing and beneficiation, road and rail transport services, and also by revising mining transport infrastructure costs and rail charges. The Company has received written quotes from a number of major Australian mining, mining service and transport groups for the provision of these services. Due to the general slowdown in the Western Australian mining sector, the quotes received are more competitive and commercial than when the PFS was published in 2012.ULARRING PROJECT RECEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALApproval for the development of the Project was granted by the Western Australian Minister for Environment; Heritage (news release October 25, 2013).A SUCCESSFUL WATER RESOURCE DRILLING PROGRAM WAS COMPLETEDNine reverse circulation holes were drilled for a total of 1,320 metres with a view to adding to the water resources announced in the PFS. The holes were drilled over a strike length of three kilometres with seven of the nine holes returning airlift flow rates of between 1 litre per second to 2.5 litres per second. Long term pump rate testing produced a flow rate of two to three litres per second. In addition to this, Macarthur has applied for three water leases over three paleochannel tributaries and further water exploration is required to confirm the capacity of those systems.Macarthur is confident that it has identified sufficient water sources for road construction, dust suppression and the initial mining and process as outlined in the PFS.Port of Esperance MUIOF ExpansionESPERANCE PORT CONFIRMS PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION RECEIVEDIn June 2013 the Esperance Port Authority (\"EPSL\") announced that two consortia had been short listed to participate in a Request for Proposal process to design, finance, build and operate a new multi-user iron ore facility (\"MUIOF\") at the Port of Esperance (\"Port\"). In December 2013, EPSL acknowledged that proposals had been received from the two short listed parties and EPSL is expecting to select a preferred party in the first quarter of 2014. The construction time frames for the MUIOF have not been fully disclosed but it is expected that initial capacity will be available in 2015.Review of Macarthur's 2013 Program(refer to Project Update news release issued January 22, 2013)Q1 - Q2 2013Advance the Company's infrastructure development timeframe for the construction of the MUIOF at the Port.This program was completed and it is now apparent that the short listed consortia have given active consideration to some of Macarthur's preliminary design concepts.Negotiate conditions for the Assessment on Proponents Information assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency.This program was completed and environmental approval was granted with normal environmental monitoring conditions.Development of a Mining Proposal for lodgement with the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum (\"DMP\") for final Mining Approval.This document has been completed and lodgement can proceed once the final feasibility is available. Statutory approval time for this is generally less than six weeks.2,500 metre water resource drilling program to explore for water on the Company's tenements in the vicinity of the Snark deposit.As mentioned earlier, this program resulted in 1,320 metres being drilled adding to the Project's available water resources.Further definition of the Magnetite Mineral Resource for the Moonshine Magnetite Project.This work was undertaken but due to the focus on the Ularring Hematite Project, the resource modelling has not yet been completed.Completion of a bulk sampling program to support pilot process plant trials with one tonne of material processed.The results of this work triggered a process flow sheet review and detailed ore body characterisation modelling has now been completed and is being interpreted by independent consultants. It is anticipated that the results of this will be ready for release in Q1 2014.Preliminary evaluation of the nickel and gold potential of the Macarthur tenements.This review was completed and numerous highly prospective nickel targets were identified.A detailed update on this review is provided later in this announcement.The completed review of the historical nickel and gold data combined with positive recent observations will be used to seek a joint venture party to continue an exploration program.Q3 - Q4 2013Lodgement of the Ularring Hematite Project Mining Proposal for review by the DMP.This proposal has been drafted subject to the completion of a feasibility study.Finalisation of transport and logistics studies for the road and rail components of the Ularring Hematite Project.This work is complete with the results indicating substantial benefits from the incorporation of a private haul route from the Central deposit through to the Yundaga rail siding site, south of the township of Menzies. A Miscellaneous Lease was granted for the haul road route, and an application for a Miscellaneous Lease for the Yundaga rail siding site has been submitted.Identification of parties for the contracting of mining, processing and beneficiation, transport and logistics activities, and onsite infrastructure such as camp and power generating facilities.The successful EOI program mentioned above resulted in a range of submissions that are currently under review. In aggregate the mining, processing and road transport contract value of the Ularring Hematite Project is estimated to exceed $1billion over the life of mine, which has attracted the interest of a number of major groups seeking to build their mining and logistics contracting business books in the context of a slowdown in the mining industry in Australia.The identification of a 'farm in' partner for the Company's Moonshine Magnetite Project.Due to the market's prevailing pessimistic view throughout 2012 - 2013 about the long term iron ore price and the requirements for significant capital to develop this iron resource the search for the right strategic partner continues. This project remains well documented and can be made available when interest returns to the magnetite sector.Secure financing for the construction of the Ularring Hematite Project, following clarity on Port access.The Ularring Haematite Project has been a core focus for the Company during 2013. Project financing has been hindered to date by:the prevailing long term iron ore forecast by resource analysts;lack of clarity around the Government's ability to attract private sector interest to design, build and operate a new MUIOF at the Port; andhigher operational costs for the Ularring Hematite Project based on the 2012 PFS.All of these hindrances are diminishing with:spot prices for iron ore remaining above previous forecasts, circa above US$130 per tonne;as mentioned earlier, EPSL has nearly completed its procurement process for the MUIOF;the Company has actively addressed the operational and capital cost assumptions of the 2012 PFS with a comprehensive review of ore body characterisation, process flow sheet design as well as the EOI program to re-quote all the core mining, transport and infrastructure contracts; anda falling Australian dollar exchange rate, circa below 90 cents USD, positively impacts on the Project.Macarthur's President, Chairman and CEO, Alan Phillips commented that,\"2013 was a tough year, in fact, one of the hardest in my 50 years of mining experience. It is good to see a returning optimism in the sector and a real commitment by major contractors to focusing on delivering a commercial price for their services. We have been active during the year to continue to evolve and de-risk the Project. This has occurred with a watchful eye on resources within the Company. Whilst we did reduce our workforce substantially in 2013, this has allowed the Company, through its strong and capable Board and professional management to manage our way through a difficult period for global resources\".The Year AheadIn 2014 Macarthur aims to continue the path toward development of the Ularring Hematite Project. A revision of the Ularring Hematite Project's PFS opex and capex is being prepared for release in Q1, 2014. In addition to this, an announcement about the successful consortium for the development of the MUIOF at the Port is expected in Q1 2014.2014 brings a changing outlook in the iron ore market and the first signs of renewed interest from the Canadian equity markets. A new optimism for long term iron ore pricing is reflected in re-rating of iron ore price forecasts by most of the resource analysts.Nickel Exploration DevelopmentsPrior to acquisition of the projects there were two previous periods of limited exploration activity for nickel over parts of the present tenement package.The tenements were briefly explored for nickel during the late 1960s nickel boom and was then further explored by several companies for gold in the mid 1990s with only very limited shallow reconnaissance drilling undertaken by these explorers.Combined with available historical data, new geological, geophysical and geochemical data obtained in the course of Macarthur's extensive geological investigation of the Banded Iron Formation (\"BIF\") between 2007 and 2013, indicates that there is potential for nickel sulphide and gold mineralisation within the extensive ultramafic rock package hosting the BIFs.By way of example, in January 2013 Macarthur drilled diamond hole LGDD_054, to test high grade magnetite. This hole was collared in ultramafic and was seen to contain unusual textures and veins of a black mineral thought to be after sulphide. Assaying of the\u00c2\u00a0core\u00c2\u00a0returned from 4.5m to 28.0m (23.5m) 0.85% Ni and this included\u00c2\u00a01.03% Ni\u00c2\u00a0over an\u00c2\u00a011.5 meter\u00c2\u00a0interval from 10.5m to 22.0m\u00c2\u00a0at an estimated\u00c2\u00a0true width\u00c2\u00a0of around\u00c2\u00a08m. The intersection also shows very low Ca and high Mg and Cr. The rock is highly weathered and is therefore not conclusive evidence for presence of nickel sulphides, but is encouraging.The location of LGDD_054 is given in the table below. Analysis of core samples was completed at ALS Perth Laboratory with Ni (interval 0 - 33.4m) analysed using method PGM-ICP23 (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry).Hole IDType of HoleTarget TypeProspectTenementPurposeGDA*Easting (Metres)GDA*Northing (Metres)Dip (Degree)E.O.H Depth (Metres)LGDD_054Diamond CoreMagnetiteMoonshine NorthM30/228Target high grade magnetite at depth788,0836,674,746-90370*GDA is the Geocentric Datum of AustraliaDuring February 2013, four reverse circulation holes for a total of 1,050 m were drilled for nickel in areas identified as showing elevated nickel values in historic soil sampling. The nickel holes are planned to be used for Electro Magnetic downhole surveys in four strategic areas. No further drilling has been performed.The review and evaluation of geochemical and geophysical data has identified significant exploration targets for nickel. These targets include some fifteen areas considered prospective for discovery of sulphide style nickel within the belt of ultramafic rocks. The targets are associated with potentially significant anomalous highly magnetic ultramafic footwall 'bulges', which may represent a thickening and embayment of the komatiite flow into the footwall stratigraphy.Much of the Macarthur's historical nickel exploration data together with recent observations suggest a favourable environment for the occurrence of nickel sulphide deposits.Macarthur is seeking a partner to continue the gold and nickel exploration.QUALIFIED PERSONSMr Ian S Cooper, B.Sc., A.R.S.M., F.G.S.

Jolly, a former aide to Young, received 45 percent of the vote in the three-way primary, according to unofficial results from the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections.Once reliably Republican, the district along Florida's Gulf coast has backed the party's presidential nominee only once since 1988. Former President George W. Bush, a Republican, won 51 percent of the district's votes in 2004, but it went for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.Jolly, 41, will face Democrat Alex Sink, the state's former chief financial officer and the 2010 nominee for governor, in a general election on March 11. Libertarian Lucas Overby also will be on the ballot.Sink, considered the strong front-runner, has raised more than $1 million in campaign contributions, more than all three Republican candidates combined, according to the latest campaign filings.\"It's Sink's to lose,\" said Susan MacManus, a Tampa-based political scientist at the University of South Florida.Whichever candidate wins in March will have to run again almost immediately because Young, had he lived, would have faced re-election November 4, when all 435 U.S. House members will be on the ballot for the so-called midterm elections.The March race is being watched to gauge the possible impact Obamacare may have on the midterms, so named because they come halfway through the four-year term of the U.S. President, McManus said.\"People are looking at it as kind of a bellwether on whether Obamacare is going to hurt a Democrat in the general election,\" MacManus said.Sink supports Obamacare and Jolly has said he would support repealing it.MacManus said the 13th congressional district skews older, whiter and politically transitional, with registered Republicans currently outnumbering Democrats by 37.1 percent to 34.7 percent.SECOND CHANCESome Republicans have been disappointed that none of the party's heavy hitters chose to challenge Sink.However, should Sink win, another Republican candidate could emerge to take her on in November, MacManus said.The Republican candidates on Tuesday's ballot were little known outside the district.Besides Jolly, who stressed his long experience as Young's congressional aide, State Rep. Kathleen Peters portrayed herself as the candidate who best understands her district from her years in elective office.Mark Bircher, an Iraq war veteran, presented himself as an outsider and the most conservative of the three Republicans.Just 10 days before voters headed to the polls, any boost the Republicans hoped for from Young's popularity and family man image was lost.The Tampa Bay Times reported in January about Young's personal life, including details about his first marriage. He quietly left his wife in 1985 to marry his secretary, who was half his age.The divorce records were sealed, and the first wife remained quiet as a condition of alimony, the Times reported.Young's potential posthumous impact on the race was further diluted when his second wife, Beverly, endorsed Jolly while one of his sons endorsed Peters in what the Times reported as a public rift between mother and son.It was another fissure in the fractured local Republican Party as it prepares to face Democrats in the general election in March.\"There wasn't a consensus nominee here,\" McManus said, \"which will put the burden on the Republicans to put Humpty Dumpty back together.\"(Editing by Gunna Dickson, Sharon Bernstein andKen Wills)"], "2014/01/14/idUSnHUGdsQK+73+ONE20140114": ["TiLoTag, coming soon to your smartphone", "2014/01/14", "\u00c2Putting Messages In Their Place\u00c2Cooper City, Fl -- Jan 14, 2014 / (http://www.myprgenie.com) -- TiLoTag was invented by a 25 year veteran firefighter and online entreprenuer, Ray Briant.

Cairo plans to support such protests in an effort to cripple Hamas.\"Gaza is next,\" said one senior security official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \"We cannot get liberated from the terrorism of the Brotherhood in Egypt without ending it in Gaza, which lies on our borders.\"Asked why Egyptian intelligence is not going after Hamas now, another senior security official said: \"Their day will come.\"Egypt accuses Hamas of backing al Qaeda-linked militant groups which have stepped up attacks against security forces in Egypt's Sinai peninsula over the past few months. The attacks have spread to Cairo and other cities.Both the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas deny accusations of terrorism, and the Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism. The group was ousted from power in Egypt after the military threw its weight behind street protests last summer.Freely-elected president Mohamed Mursi is now on trial on charges of inciting the murder of protesters during his presidency. Egypt's military-backed government has cracked down hard on the Brotherhood, arresting almost its entire leadership and thousands of its backers as well as formally declaring it a terrorist organization.But the situation is very different in Gaza, where Hamas, an offshoot of the Brotherhood, is heavily armed, has years of experience fighting Israel, and moves swiftly to squash dissent.A Hamas official said the comments made to Reuters by Egyptian officials showed Cairo was inciting violence and trying to provoke chaos.\"We reaffirm that Hamas did not and never would intervene in the internal Egyptian affairs,\" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. \"No one should ever dream to weaken Hamas.\"\"A LOT OF ANGER\"So far, contacts between Egypt and Fatah have been limited to discussing ways to help Fatah undermine Hamas, said the officials. They declined to name Palestinians involved in those discussions or give details of how many meetings have been held.Hamas keeps Fatah party officials under very close watch in Gaza. A senior Fatah official in the occupied West Bank, where the party is far more powerful, denied any plot to oust Hamas.\"There is a lot of anger in Gaza. People are suffering, but protest is not easy. We cannot hope that Hamas will vanish tomorrow,\" he said.Hamas has an estimated 20,000 fighters, with another 20,000 in its police and security forces. Despite growing economic hardship in Gaza, the group can still draw on significant support from among the territory's 1.8 million people.But Egyptian officials hope to exploit tensions with rival militant groups, even if there are no signs of major splits yet.\"We know that Hamas is powerful and armed but we also know that there are other armed groups in Gaza that are not on good terms with Hamas and they could be used to face Hamas,\" another Egyptian security source said.\"All people want is to eat, drink and have a decent living, and if a government, armed or not, fails to provide that, then the people will rise against it in the end,\" the source said.\"THE FIRST SPARK\"In early January, Cairo publicly hosted the first conference of a new anti-Hamas youth group called Tamarud, or rebel, the same name used by the Egyptian youth movement that led last year's protests against Mursi.Members of the Palestinian Tamarud stood with the Palestinian flag wrapped around their necks to highlight what they called Hamas's crimes against activists in Gaza.The event was attended by representatives from Egyptian liberal parties and Fatah.\"We support the movement and any peaceful movement against the cruelty of the Islamist group that is part of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization,\" said Ayman al-Raqb, a Fatah official in Cairo in his speech at the conference.The activists showed video clips of masked gunmen chasing and dragging away protesters, and posted banners showing activists who they said had been tortured by Hamas for their opposition.The Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights last year accused Hamas of orchestrating a fierce crackdown against activists suspected of trying to organize a Tamarud-like protest in November. It said some of those detained were tortured and the mooted rally never materialized.Hamas has accused Tamarud members of being Israeli agents, but has denied allegations of torture.Activists in Cairo have called for protests in Gaza on March 21.Egyptian officials hope that future Hamas crackdowns may turn the tide against the movement's leadership.\"Surely, the world will not stand still and allow Hamas to kill Palestinians. Someone will interfere,\" said the Egyptian security official. \"But so far we are only working on firing the first spark.\"But officials also concede that the plan is likely to take years.\"The aid Egypt will mainly provide to the anti-Hamas groups will be logistical not financial. Tamaruds don't cost much,\" one Egyptian security official said.TUNNELSThe plan to undermine Hamas reflects renewed confidence among Egypt's security forces after being sidelined following the fall of long-time president Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Senior security officials are now determined to eliminate their Islamist foes for good - inside and outside Egypt.They were angry when Mursi became the first Egyptian president to meet Hamas leaders in the presidential palace. Mursi also sent his prime minister to Gaza on the second day of an Israeli offensive on the enclave in November 2012.Many Egyptians believe the Brotherhood intended to give part of the Sinai to Hamas. The Brotherhood has consistently denied the allegation.Mursi's administration did acknowledge the problem posed by the tunnels under the border between Egypt and Gaza. His national security adviser last year said the government was flooding a number of tunnels he described as illegal.But the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza was kept open for much of Mursi's rule, allowing vital food and goods to flow into Gaza.After Mursi's overthrow, the army took over command of the Sinai and started destroying hundreds of tunnels. No Hamas official has been allowed to travel into Egypt since then.Last month, Egypt's public prosecutor accused Hamas of conspiring with Mursi and Iran to stage terrorist attacks in Egypt.\"We know Hamas is the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood (members) are terrorists and no country could develop with terrorists in or around it,\" the security official said.Gaza prime minister and Hamas deputy leader Ismail Haniyeh has said repeatedly since July that his group is focused exclusively on confronting arch-foe Israel and has no armed presence in Egypt.\"We do not intervene in Egyptian internal affairs,\" he told supporters last month. \"Egypt cannot do without us and we cannot do without Egypt. This historical, geographic and security link can never be severed.\"However, an Egyptian security official, who declined to be named, dismissed his words. \"They (Hamas leaders) can say what they want on their role in Sinai. We don't base our judgment on them, but on intelligence and information.\"(Additional reporting byCrispian Balmerand Nidal Al Mughrabi; Editing by Michael Georgy andSimon Robinson)"], "2014/01/14/datalink-brief-idUSWEN00C3I20140114": ["BRIEF-Datalink shares up 25.1 pct after the bell following guidance", "2014/01/14", "NEW YORKJan 14 (Reuters) - Datalink Corp :\n * Shares were up 25.1 percent after the bell following guidance"], "2014/01/14/db-x-trackers-msci-europ-idUSnBw145762a+100+BSW20140114": [0, "2014/01/14", "Net Asset Value(s)FUND\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 db x-trackers MSCI Europe Small Cap Index UCITS ETFDEALING DATE\u00c2\u00a6 13-Jan-14NAV PER SHARE\u00c2\u00a6 USD39.2810NUMBER OF SHARES IN ISSUE\u00c2\u00a6 14,450,691CODE\u00c2\u00a6db x-trackers MSCI Europ Small Cap ETF"], "2014/01/14/nc-red-hat-ncta-idUSnBw145632a+100+BSW20140114": [0, "2014/01/14", "Red Hat Continues North America Partner Program MomentumRed Hat Updates North America Partner Program with Changes to Deal \n      Registrations and Teaming Agreements, and Additional Partner Enablement \n      and TrainingRed Hat North America Partner Conference\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Red Hat, Inc. \n      (NYSE:RHT), the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading provider of open source solutions, today \n      announced continued momentum and program enhancements for its North \n      America channel partner ecosystem.

Benefits to all partners include priority \n      resource allocation, increased margins, rewards for new business growth, \n      sales alignment, and support from Red Hat sales and technical resources. \n      A key element of this program is its multiple year renewal protection. \n      With it, deal registration benefits are available on the initial order \n      and two subsequent annual renewals.Red Hat Teaming Incentive ProgramTeaming agreements assist in engaging sales teams and act as a mechanism \n      for collaboration, encouraging teams to work together to develop and \n      drive net-new business. Through its new Teaming Incentive Program which \n      also took effect Sept. 1, 2013, Red Hat rewards its partners with an \n      incremental value incentive discount (VID) for value-add, pre-sale \n      activities when teaming early with Red Hat on opportunities.

Once completed, we expect to have a significantly improved cost structure to drive profitability and competitiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 We expect our fiscal second quarter results to reflect significant impairment and restructuring charges, however the cash component should be less than$20 million.\u00c2\u00a0 We expect this amount to be partially offset in future quarters as we sell idled assets.\u00c2\u00a0 With approximately$111 millionin cash atDecember 31stand no debt, we believe we have a very strong balance sheet to support us through this transition period. \u00c2\u00a0At this stage, we anticipate most of the cost reductions to be in place by the fiscal third quarter, which we believe will put us on a path back to profitability.\"\u00c2About MFLEXMFLEX (www.mflex.com) is a global provider of high-quality, technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and assemblies to the electronics industry.

Fattah, architect of the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative (FNI), and lead Democrat on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) and related agencies worked closely with ChairmanFrank Wolf(R-VA) to make neuroscience funding a priority in the subcommittee's section of the appropriations bill.The bill provides$7.7 billionfor the National Science Foundation (NSF), and a requested increase of$13.85 millionfor new cross-Foundation investments in cognitive science and neuroscience research. This complements the approximately$5.5 billionannually spent by the government on neuroscience through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Further, the measure encourages the NSF to work in conjunction with the Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN). In 2011, Fattah joined with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to create the IWGN, which coordinates brain research across a dozen federal agencies.\"I was proud to work with my colleagues on a CJS appropriations bill that, while not perfect, makes a strategic and significant investment in medical research and innovation, including funding for neuroscience,\" Congressman Fattah said. \"The new$13 millionincrease of neuroscience funding will fund breakthrough research, advancing our knowledge and understanding of brain disease, and boosting the efforts of the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative.\"The legislation also includes language promoting international collaboration, a major tenet of the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative. In recent months, Fattah has traveled to Israel andEuropefor conversations with international leaders on future neuroscience cooperation withthe United States. Last month, with Rep.Steve Israel, Fattah spearheaded an international neuroscience research alliance between organizations inthe United Statesand Israel.\"We know that this is a global challenge which requires global resources and partnership.

(NASDAQ:ARUN), a leading provider of \n      next-generation network access solutions for the mobile enterprise, \n      today announced that the Oyster River Cooperative School District \n      (ORCSD), a K-12 school district serving the contiguous communities of \n      Durham, Lee and Madbury in New Hampshire, is deploying a unified wired \n      and wireless access network based on Aruba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sMobile \n      Virtual Enterprise (MOVE)architecture. The new network is enabling \n      ORCSD to securely support Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and to connect \n      the district-owned mobile devices already deployed in its classrooms, \n      expanding student access to online educational materials and resources.Students at Oyster River Cooperative School District use a mix of personal and school-issued mobile devices in the classroom to access educational resources via the school district's new Aruba Networks infrastructure. (Photo: Business Wire)Like many school districts, ORCSD has seen a growing number of its \n      students bringing mobile devices into the classroom. The \n      forward-thinking district viewed this trend as an opportunity to \n      supplement district-owned mobile devices and move toward a 1:1 \n      initiative, where every student has access to a mobile device for \n      connecting with online information and data that reinforce and build \n      upon classroom teachings.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our overall goal is to enhance student learning and enrich classroom \n      lessons,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Josh Olstad, IT Director for ORCSD. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our students are \n      already bringing multiple devices to school, so it makes sense for us to \n      allow these devices to access the network and the valuable educational \n      resources that reside on it. With the new Aruba infrastructure, we can \n      allow students and teachers to connect securely with their personal or \n      district-issued devices so they can obtain the information and tools \n      they need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdORCSD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prior network could not support the growing number of mobile \n      devices that the district was encountering in its classrooms, nor was it \n      able to deliver and manage the same levels of network access for both \n      BYOD and district-provided devices that ORCSD wanted. After a thorough \n      evaluation of vendor solutions available, ORCSD selected Aruba for the \n      new unified access network. The school district then called upon New \n      Hampshire-based Adaptive Communications to deploy the network, which is \n      comprised ofAruba \n      Instant controller-less access points (APs), theAirWave \n      Network Management System, theClearPass \n      Access Management SystemandAruba \n      Mobility Access Switches.The ease of deployment and simplified management that the Aruba Instant \n      APs offered ORCSD \u00e2\u20ac\u201c critical for K-12 school districts with limited IT \n      staffs and budgets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were key factors in the district\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to \n      choose Aruba. Aruba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ClearPass solution, which allows ORCSD to ensure \n      that each user on the network has the right access privileges based on \n      who they are and what device they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using, was another key reason the \n      district selected Aruba.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153After our review process, it became clear that only Aruba could handle \n      the wide range of mobile devices on our network including tablets, \n      notebooks, netbooks and e-readers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and securely on-board these devices \n      whether they were our own or brought into the schools by students, \n      teachers or guests,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Olstad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With ClearPass, we can easily profile \n      the devices and then give them the proper access. This saves us a \n      significant amount of time and effort so we can focus on other important \n      IT projects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdIn addition to the district\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT department, ORCSD teachers are also \n      enthusiastic about the improved network access and performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With \n      the new Aruba infrastructure, my students can easily and reliably access \n      the educational resources that I post, conduct thorough research and \n      work online with the mobile devices we provide or those they bring from \n      home,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Amanda Zeller, a 7thGrade Language Arts teacher \n      for Oyster River Middle School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new network opens up a wide range \n      of online resources that I can use to enhance my teaching and improve my \n      students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 educational experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdAbout Aruba Networks, Inc.Aruba Networks is a leading provider of next-generation network access \n      solutions for the mobile enterprise.

Bravada requested that the authors of the technical report address the issues raised by the BCSC, which it has done. Bravada is filing the amended report and it is being posted on SEDAR and the Company's websitewww.bravadagold.com.The amended report includes: additional summary of information in the 2007 resource estimate reported in NI 43- 101 Technical Report by Noble and Ranta (2007); removal of a clause in the Author's Certificate; addition of estimated corporate taxes to the cash-flow model; addition of required cautionary language for the inclusion of Inferred resources in the cash-flow model and mine plan; and deletion of portions of Table 16.4 that combined together Inferred and Indicated resources.Technical disclosure issues in the Company's website, fact sheet and corporate presentation.The Company is clarifying certain disclosures made in the Company's corporate presentations, fact sheets, and on the Company's website as detailed further in this news release solely for the purpose of complying with NI 43- 101's technical disclosure rules.Non-Compliant Disclosure of Preliminary Economic AssessmentThe disclosure of its preliminary economic evaluation in news releases of May 1 and 15, 2012; the President's Letter of June 19, 2013; a corporate video; the Company website; and the corporate presentation for the Wind Mountain Project reported \"Pre-tax\" costs and economic parameters, which included Nevada Net Proceeds Tax but which did not include an estimate of Corporate Income Tax, which may substantially overstate the value of the project. An estimate of the effect of Corporate Tax on economic parameters has been calculated and will be included in the modified Technical Report. After- tax parameters will be included in updates to the Company website and corporate presentations.The amended Technical Report presents Pre-tax and estimated After-tax parameters as follows: Undiscounted life-of-mine pre-tax cash flow is US$63.3 million and US$42.2 million after-tax Net present value at 5% discount rate pre-tax is US42.9 million and US26.5 million after-tax Internal rate of return pre-tax is 29% and 21% after-tax.A preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.Non-Compliant Disclosure within non-Company presentationsThe Company provided a non-Company presentation on its website that included potentially misleading statements. Specifically in Jay Taylor's Hotline Message, the discussion did not make it clear that Corporate Tax was not considered in the PEA when Mr. Taylor stated that the Wind Mountain Project has \"Robust Economics\", which may be misleading to investors. In addition thecautionary languagein section 1 above regarding a PEA should have been included. This non-Company presentation has been removed from the Company's website and the Company advises investors not to rely on it.Non-Compliant Exploration TargetSlides from a December 2013 geologic talk presented by the Company President to the Northwest MiningConference were posted on the Company's website. Several of the slides could be misleading when examined outside of the context of the talk. The presentation has been removed from the website to avoid potentially misleading investors.Specifically, slide 22 on the December 2013 geologic talk referred to the Hishikari mine in Japan, with reference to gold production figures and reserves for that mine. Slide 22 contained a target labeled \"High- grade Hishikari target???\" The Hishikari deposit model is well-known in the geologic community. The suggestion of that style of mineralization being present at Wind Mountain is based on several similarities between the geologic setting at Wind Mountain and the Hishikari mine, and was not intended to imply that the Company has any data that suggests grades or tonnages will be similar to those of the Hirshikari mine. Geologic similarities include being very young, low-sulfidation-types of gold mineralization. More specifically, high-grade gold mineralization at Hishikari is primarily located at the unconformity between impermeable basement rocks and more permeable young volcanics, a natural pathway for mineralizing fluids. The analogous unconformity at Wind Mountain has not been intersected with drilling and it is not exposed at surface; thus, making it a speculative target with no indication at this time of the potential size or grade. The presentation has been removed from the website to avoid potential confusion to investors.Non-Compliant Disclosure of Mineral Resource PotentialTwo slides in the corporate presentation (slides 11 and 12) and in the December 2013 geology talk for the Northwest Mining Conference (slides 15 and 16) refer to \"areas of probable under-estimated Au grade\" and \"under estimated grade potential\" at Wind Mountain. Although there are geologic reasons to believe these statements, primarily the lateral continuity of gold grade in blast-hole assays in the historically mined portion of the deposit, they are speculative until proven with further drilling. These slides have been modified to eliminate these speculative statements.In addition, slide 10 on the December 2013 Northwest Mining Conference shows a $2000 pit outline, which was produced by the engineering company that produced the PEA but was not included in the PEA. The intent of the slide was to show several areas that are under-drilled but still support a small pit at a gold price of $2000 even without further delineation drilling. Delineation drilling in these areas could extend mineralization, potentially allowing development as shallow open pits at lower gold prices. The disclosure did not show downside sensitivity to gold price; thus, could be misleading to investors. The December 2013 presentation has been removed from the website and the same slide in the corporate presentation is being modified to show the pit modeled for a gold price of $1300, which was the base case in the PEA. Slide 26 in the corporate presentation used the local informal name \"Highland Resource Area,\" potentially misleading investors to believe a resource has been estimated for this area. There is no resource estimated in that area at this time, and the name has been changed on the slide to \"Highland Main Zone.\"Qualified PersonOn the Company website, presentation and fact sheet the Company did not disclose the relationship to the Company of the qualified person who approved the technical information disclosed. Joseph Anthony Kizis, Jr., who is a non-independent Qualified Person within the meaning of NI 43-101, is the President of Bravada, which has now been clarified on the website, the corporate presentation, and the fact sheet where he supervised and approved the disclosure of that technical information. Mr. Kizis also supervised the preparation and approved of the disclosure in this news release.About Bravada Gold CorporationBravada is a member of the Manex Resource Group of companies with an exploration office in Reno, from which it is exploring its extensive Carlin-type and low-sulfidation-type gold holdings strategically located within numerous productive gold trends in Nevada.

The shortage of mental health care providers combined with the lack of psychiatric beds leaves patients with psychiatric illness out in the cold.\"Georgia's46thplace ranking in the category of Access to Emergency Care reflects shortages across the full spectrum of medical providers, such as emergency physicians, neurosurgeons, orthopedists and registered nurses. In addition, the state has too few physicians accepting Medicare patients and more than 20 percent of adults and more than 10 percent of children are uninsured. The state also has fewer than 18 psychiatric care beds per 100,000 residents.The two D+'s, in Public Health and Injury Prevention and Disaster Preparedness, rankedGeorgiain the bottom half of the nation in those categories. The state has some of the lowest immunization rates in the country for influenza and pneumonia and very high rates of bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities. In addition,Georgia'sability to respond to disasters is seriously compromised because it is nearly last in the nation for physicians, nurses and behavioral health professionals being registered in the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals.Georgiaonly earned a C in the category of Quality and Patient Safety Environment in part because it lacks a uniform system for providing pre-arrival instructions as well as funding for quality improvement within the EMS system in the state.The state's best grade, a B- for Medical Liability Environment, ranked it 12thin the country in this category, in part because it prohibits apologies by providers from being used as evidence of wrongdoing and because it has enacted additional liability protections for care provided in the emergency department.\"Georgia'sracial and ethnic disparities for cardiovascular disease, HIV diagnoses and infant mortality are unacceptable,\" said Dr. Keadey. \"We need to work to ensure that all of our residents have adequate access to preventive health care, education, treatment and support to reduce these disparities.\"\"America's Emergency Care Environment:\u00c2\u00a0 A State-by-State Report Card \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2014\" evaluates conditions under which emergency care is being delivered, not the quality of care provided by hospitals and emergency providers.

Industrial and\nCommercial Bank of China , the world's\nlargest bank by assets, had said on Thursday that it would not\nassume the \"main responsibility\" for repaying investors in a\ntroubled off-balance-sheet investment product that it helped to\nmarket.Macau Legend, which only listed in June after\nreducing the size of its IPO, sank 4.6 percent after announcing\nplans to raise $1.35 billion in a sale of as many as 188 million\nnew shares priced at a 7.8 percent discount to its Thursday\nclosing price.But there were gains for China COSCO Holdings\n , whose shares climbed 5.3 percent in Hong\nKong and 2 percent in Shanghai after China's largest bulk\nshipping company said on Thursday it returned to profit in 2013,\navoiding a possible A-share delisting after losses for two\nconsecutive years.China Oilfield Services surged 6.2 percent in Hong\nKong.

Some foreclosure filings entered into the database during the year may have been recorded in the previous year. Data is collected from more than 2,200 counties nationwide, and those counties account for more than 90 percent of the U.S. population. RealtyTrac's report incorporates documents filed in all three phases of foreclosure:Default--Notice of Default(NOD) andLis Pendens(LIS);Auction-- Notice of Trustee Sale and Notice of Foreclosure Sale (NTS and NFS); andReal Estate Owned, orREO properties(that have been foreclosed on and repurchased by a bank). For the annual and quarterly reports, if more than one type of foreclosure document is received for a property during the year or quarter, only the most recent filing is counted in the report. The annual, quarterly and monthly reports all check if the same type of document was filed against a property previously. If so, and if that previous filing occurred within the estimated foreclosure timeframe for the state where the property is located, the report does not count the property in the current year, quarter or month.Report LicenseThe RealtyTrac U.S. Foreclosure Market Report is the result of a proprietary evaluation of information compiled by RealtyTrac; the report and any of the information in whole or in part can only be quoted, copied, published, re-published, distributed and/or re-distributed or used in any manner if the user specifically references RealtyTrac as the source for said report and/or any of the information set forth within the report.Data Licensing and Custom Report OrderInvestors, businesses and government institutions can contact RealtyTrac to license bulk foreclosure and neighborhood data or purchase customized reports.

(TSX:HF) (\"Hanfeng\" or the \"Corporation\") reported today on its current situation during its management transition.Governance, Management and OperationsAs previously disclosed, the former CEO, Xinduo Yu, was removed on January 7, 2014, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation as an officer of the Corporation, and as an officer, director or legal representative of any subsidiary of the Corporation. All other directors of the Corporation's subsidiaries were removed on January 10, 2014.\u00c2\u00a0Despite these board authorized changes, subsequent to his dismissal, the former CEO has made public representations that he does not intend to respect the decision of the Board of Directors, and said in part that, \"he and his current management team will continue to lead the Hanfeng effort\" and that it is \"business as usual at Hanfeng\".The Corporation is now taking all necessary steps to notify the applicable regulatory authorities and third parties in China, and elsewhere, of these changes and to make the applicable registrations and regulatory filings in connection with these changes. The government filings that are required in China to change the legal representative and to replace directors are in process. The Corporation has retained Chinese legal counsel to assist in these steps and generally to provide legal advice concerning compliance with Chinese laws, and as previously announced, has retained FTI Consulting as interim manager in China.\u00c2\u00a0The Corporation has been advised that the process of fully transitioning governance and management, particularly in China, can require as long as six weeks, or possibly longer, particularly in circumstances such as these where the former CEO continues to represent to personnel and third parties, directly or indirectly, that he is still an officer of the parent Corporation or an officer, director or legal representative of the subsidiaries.As the Corporation's news release stated on January 8, 2014, this management transition is a complex process occurring within a global enterprise operating under multiple corporate legal systems. Accordingly, such changes are not fully accomplished instantly.Since the removal of the CEO, and the removal of all other directors of the subsidiaries, the management of the subsidiaries has been advised of these changes and, at this point in time,\u00c2\u00a0it is uncertain whether or not the management in China or in the other subsidiaries will accept or respect these changes on a timely basis without further action being taken. Neither the Corporation nor FTI Consulting is in a position to confirm whether the new legal representatives and directors appointed to each of the Corporation's two subsidiaries in China, or the new directors of the other subsidiaries, are able to perform their roles and responsibilities in cooperation with its staff. The Corporation's appointed legal representatives are not in possession of the official company seals, referred to as \"chops\" for the two subsidiaries in China.Electronic CommunicationsSubsequent to the termination of the CEO, the electronic communications for the Corporation's e-mail\u00c2\u00a0(@hanfengevergreen.com) and web site (www.hanfengevergreen.com) were transferred to a new service provider in China without the approval of the Board of Directors or the management team in Canada. Electronic communications for certain Chinese subsidiaries atwww.hanfeng-group.com\u00c2\u00a0are directly or indirectly under the control of the former CEO and control has not yet been transitioned to the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation is in the process of attempting to regain complete control of these communication platforms and in the meantime advises all parties sending or receiving e-mails or communicating by way of any e-mail associated with the domains hanfengevergreen.com or hanfeng-group.com, or any representation concerning the Corporation or its subsidiaries on those web sites and e-mail servers, that until further notice, those communication platforms are not fully under the control or direction of the Corporation and may not be relied upon.Financial SituationIn order to provide funding for Corporation's operations in Canada, the Board of Directors has previously authorized the direction and payment of funds from two Chinese subsidiaries to the Canadian parent corporation. As previously disclosed, the repatriation of funds from China to Canada is not without risk and uncertainty. In this regard, the Corporation's Annual Information Form dated September 30, 2013 previously filed onwww.sedar.comstates in part,\"Repatriation of Profit and Currency Conversion \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 any foreign exchange transaction on the capital account is subject to prior approval from the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (\"SAIC\"), and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (\"SAFE\") of the PRC. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiaries in China may pay dividends to the Corporation or pay outstanding current account obligations in foreign exchange but must present the proper documentation to a designated foreign exchange bank in order to do so. There can be no assurance that the availability of foreign currency will be sufficient for the Corporation's subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Corporation or to satisfy their other foreign currency obligations, or that the SAFE or SAIC will approve said transfer. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Furthermore, the time it takes to repatriate funds is unpredictable, and the exact process for repatriation is unclear.\"In the current circumstances, it has come to the Corporation's attention that in connection with prior directed transfers of funds on capital account from China to Canada during 2013 by one of the Corporation's Chinese subsidiaries, Hanfeng Slow-Release Fertilizer (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd (\"Jiangsu Subsidiary\"),\u00c2\u00a0one or more representatives of the Jiangsu Subsidiary is alleged to have made one or more false declarations to SAFE, which, if it occurred, would have been directly contrary to the explicit, written funding instructions that any such wire transfer was only approved subject to all relevant law and customs of the People's Republic of China. As a result, the Corporation has been informed by the management of both of its subsidiaries in China that any further fund transfer by these subsidiaries from China is held up pending the outcome of an investigation by SAFE. The Corporation, in conjunction with its legal counsel in China, is in the process of undertaking an investigation of the situation and intends to cooperate with the SAFE authorities.These restrictions on inter-company transfers have impacted the ability of the Corporation to secure the necessary funds for the sustained operations of the Canadian public company, and have had an adverse impact on liquidity. In the absence of being able to promptly return capital from China to Canada, the Corporation is exploring various financing and related alternatives, which may include seeking to source private lending, debt and/or equity capital.Given the overall situation with management reporting and operations, and internal controls and procedures, particularly in its Chinese operations, the Corporation believes there is significant risk that its financial reporting, in particular the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, may be delayed.Trading on TSXOn January 15, 2014, the Toronto Stock Exchange suspended trading in the Corporation's common shares pending clarification of the Corporation's affairs.\u00c2\u00a0As at the date of this release, the Corporation's common shares remain halted.Forward-Looking StatementsThis news\u00c2\u00a0release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, including but not limited to the Corporation's plans, objectives and expectations and the exploration by the Corporation of strategic alternatives.

(the \"Corporation\") (TSX VENTURE:MEK) announces additional wide gold intersections from the Thomas Ogden Gold Zone in Timmins, Ontario. Highlights include drill hole TOG-13-38 which returned54.65 meters (m) of 1.89 grammes per tonne (g/t) Gold (Au), including 25.70 m of 2.79 g/t Auand hole TOG-13-38 which returned17.05m of 1.90 g/t Au, including 6.05m of 4.21 g/t Au. These two in-fill holes confirm the continuous nature of the gold mineralization within the Thomas Ogden Zone and continue to expand on the resource potential. Two other holes completed in this latest drill program, TOG-13-35 and TOG-13-37 were drilled below the eastern plunge of the gold zone, confirming the location of the lower contact.The Ogden Property consists of a package of patented mining claims, covering eight kilometers of strike length along the Porcupine-Destor Break between Goldcorp's Dome Mine and Lake Shore Gold's West Timmins Mine. The Ogden Property is held under a joint venture in which Metals Creek owns 50%, and Goldcorp Canada Ltd. (\"Goldcorp\") owns 50% (as manager and on behalf of the Porcupine Joint Venture, a joint venture between Goldcorp Inc. and Goldcorp Canada Ltd.) with MEK being the operator of the project. Three separate gold zones have been identified on the property, Nabob North, Naybob South and Thomas Ogden. All have seen limited drilling since the initiation of the option/joint venture with Goldcorp, however the most recent focus has been on the newly discovered Thomas Ogden Zone. A total of 46 holes have now been completed at Thomas Ogden over the past three years and the zone has been partially defined as an easterly plunging alteration zone with mineralogy and geometry typical of other deposits along strike. High grade gold mineralization appears to correlate with flexures within the TOG stratigraphy. The zone remains open and will continue to be the focus of future drilling.Results from holes TOG-13-35 to 38 are outlined in the table below:Drill HoleNumberMetersfromMeterstoTotalMetersGold G/TUncutTOG 13-35\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2NSATOG 13-36124.95142.0017.051.90including124.95131.006.054.21TOG 13-37228.00235.857.850.50TOG 13-38164.75219.4054.651.89including164.75190.4525.702.79*Reported drill intercepts are not true widths.

Blair said there was a lack of\nevidence to establish Abadie's driving speed.Google Glass, which projects a small screen in the corner of\na wearer's eye, is expected to become a major catalyst for what\nmany believe to be the next big trend in mobile, wearable\ncomputing devices.Developers are already crafting apps to try to position\nthemselves if the devices, which can be voice- or\nmotion-activated, prove popular with consumers. Abadie said she\nis developing such apps, and she said she transmitted live video\nof herself talking to reporters outside court on Thursday.EXPLORER ON A MISSIONHighway Patrol Officer Keith Odle testified that he\nestimated Abadie had been driving her Toyota Prius at 85 miles\nper hour (137 km/h) in a 65 mph (105 km/h) zone when he pulled\nher over.Odle said he had not been planning to cite Abadie for\nwearing Google Glass, but that he did so because of her reaction\nto his questions. \"She got a little argumentative about whether\nor not it was legal for her to wear them,\" he said.Abadie, a Southern California entrepreneur who works\nindependently to develop Web and mobile apps, gained widespread\nattention in October when she quickly posted the news of her\nticket on social media.\"A cop just stopped me and gave me a ticket for wearing\nGoogle Glass while driving!\" she wrote on the Google Plus social\nnetworking site.She said outside the court after the ruling on Thursday that\nGoogle Glass does not give drivers any \"blind spot.\"\"I believe we have to start experimenting with devices like\nthis,\" Abadie told reporters. \"As a hands-free device it is\nsafer than a cell phone.\"Blair had said during the hearing that Google Glass \"falls\nwithin the purview and intent\" of the ban on driving with a\nmonitor enacted by the California legislature.The device is not yet available for sale to the general\npublic, although the company is testing the product with the\nhelp of thousands of so-called \"Explorers\" who have been given\nearly access to the technology. It is expected to come to market\nlater this year.\"Glass is built to connect you more with the world around\nyou, not distract you from it,\" Google said in a statement.Explorers should \"always use Glass responsibly and put their\nsafety and the safety of others first,\" the company said."], "2014/01/16/nj-alvogen-idUSnBw166005a+100+BSW20140116": ["Alvogen and Lotus Pharmaceuticals Merge Asian Operations to Create Compelling Platform for International Growth", "2014/01/16", "Alvogen and Lotus Pharmaceuticals Merge Asian Operations to Create \n      Compelling Platform for International GrowthAlvogen to become 67% shareholder in Lotus; Lotus to use funds to \n        acquire Alvogen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian operationCombined regional group will have increased regional market reach \n        and a broadened product portfolioExclusive marketing rights for two high-value biopharmaceuticals \n        for selective APAC markets are under negotiations between the partiesAlvogen, the multinational pharmaceuticals company, agreed in December \n      2013 to become the majority shareholder in Taiwanese Lotus \n      Pharmaceuticals (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lotus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) through a private placement of newly issued \n      shares, acquiring up to 151 million shares in the company.

Urges Incumbent Board to Refrain from Misleading Fellow Shareholders", "2014/01/17", "Concerned Shareholder of Renegade Petroleum Ltd. Urges Incumbent Board to Refrain from Misleading Fellow ShareholdersIncumbent Board has Rejected Corporate Governance Best Practices and the Recommendation of Both Iss and Glass Lewis\n\nRecent Analyst Reports and Downgrades Confirm That the Incumbent Board's Decisions on Asset Sales have Destroyed Shareholder ValueGREENWICH, CONNECTICUT--(Marketwired - Jan. 17, 2014) - FrontFour Capital Group LLC (\"FrontFour\"), a concerned shareholder of Renegade Petroleum Ltd. (\"Renegade\" or the \"Company\") today warned fellow shareholders of the Renegade board's apparent strategy to distract shareholders from the real issues facing Renegade. The Company's incumbent directors (the \"Incumbents\") have clearly become desperate and have even resorted to starting their own rumors. Renegade's recent open letter to shareholders clearly implies that FrontFour has ulterior motives and has taken short positions in the shares of Renegade. FrontFour has NEVER taken a short position in shares of Renegade. FrontFour looks forward to factual communication, accountability, and the growth in the share price of the Company after January 28th.\"While it is regrettable that the Tom Budd led board has come to rely on a campaign of misinformation, we remain steadfast in our commitment to restore Renegade's credibility and deliver value to all shareholders\", said concerned shareholder Zachary George. \"We thank fellow Renegade shareholders for the significant support we have received to date.\"The Facts Are Clear and Should Not be IgnoredThe vast majority of shareholders have lost a significant amount of their initial investment.Institutional Shareholder Services (\"ISS\") and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (\"Glass Lewis\") havebothrecommended that shareholders vote on FrontFour'sGREENproxy.This week, National Bank Financial, Raymond James, and Paradigm Capital all lowered their price targets for Renegade on the back of the Company's decision to sell $109 million of Renegade's assets to Surge Energy Inc.FrontFour Is Concerned Over Recent Communications With Renegade's Outside CounselFrontFour's legal counsel has attempted to reach an agreement with Renegade on various protocol matters related to the upcoming special meeting. Goodmans LLP (\"Goodmans\"), counsel to the Renegade special committee, has refused all material proposed protocol matters, including the appointment of an independent chair. In addition, Renegade has wrongly taken the position that FrontFour's initial requisition letter sought the election and removal of directors on a slate basis, in spite of each director being listed separately. A letter dated January 16, 2014 from Goodmans to FrontFour's counsel noted that:\"we are putting you on notice that your client's form of proxy is problematic, as it is not consistent with the requisition and Renegade's form of proxy, which we are concerned has caused confusion for shareholders\".On this basis, FrontFour is concerned that Renegade may try to improperly disenfranchise Renegade shareholders who wish to vote on an individual basis. This is yet another indication that the current board of Renegade is willing to avoid accountability at any cost, even if it means disregarding shareholders' right to vote. This potential attempt to circumvent the voting rights of the owners of the business would mark a new low in Renegade's corporate governance standards.If necessary, FrontFour intends to propose and vote its proxies in favour of an amendment to the Renegade resolutions to provide for the removal and election of directors on an individual basis. Additionally, FrontFour advises Renegade that, in anticipation of the successful election of the FrontFour director nominees, FrontFour will use all legal means to hold the Company's Incumbents personally liable for the use of Company funds to further any frivolous or vexatious legal proceedings initiated as a stalling tactic to the eventual election of thenewboard.Recent Analyst Reports Confirm Renegade's Recent Asset Sales Have Destroyed Shareholder ValueOver the last year,more than $275 million in equity value has been destroyedand the board has fumbled almost every single strategic decision put before them. Also, since the January 13, 2014, asset sale, 3 of 7 analysts (National Bank Financial, Raymond James and Paradigm Capital) reporting on Bloomberg cut their target share price citing the divestiture, which has resulted in Renegade becoming \"less sustainable\" while noting that the \"current dividend has risk\", and \"the company has not cut the dividend - something we now see as inevitable\".ISS And Glass Lewis Have Spoken, Now It's Time For Shareholders To Make Their Voices HeardOn January 10, 2014, leading proxy advisory services firm ISS found that FrontFour has made a \"compelling\" case for change to the Renegade board to better shape the strategic review process and turn around the Company and accordingly recommends that Renegade shareholdersonlyvote on FrontFour'sGREENform of proxy or voting instruction form (VIF).Excerpts from the ISS report follows (references to \"dissident\" refer to FrontFour's director nominees):The company has underperformed the S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index by approximately 33.7% on a 1- year basis until the unaffected date before the dissident announced requisition of the special shareholder meeting. The TSR underperformance gap has become larger throughout the year. It appears that the TSR performance had not materially improved since the strategic review carried out by the special committee.The special committee has implemented some changes since the beginning of the strategic review, such as a dividend reduction, non-core asset transactions, board and management change, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6., however, to date it appears that the market has not responded well to those special committee initiatives as the company's share price has continued downward since the launch of the strategic review.Since the dissident has made a compelling case for some change to the board to better shape the strategic review process and turn around the company\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the dissident has met the burden of proving that some change on the board is warranted.In addition, on January 16, 2014, Glass Lewis also recommended shareholders vote on the FrontFourGREENform of proxy, stating,\"Given the Company's poor financial results and frustrating decline in value, even after significant operational and personnel changes, we believe there is a reasonable case that a degree of change is warranted.\"Time Is Short - Shareholders Need To Act Now By Voting TheirGREENProxyFrontFour continues to implore shareholders to judge the current board not on what they say but on what they have done and urge shareholders to continue the wave of momentum by voting theGREENproxy to strengthen Renegade's board and ultimately save your investment.Regardless of how many Renegade shares you own, it is imperative you vote yourGREENproxy to put an end to the current board's track record of strategic missteps, weak financial controls, and poor governance.Even if shareholders have already voted using management's form of proxy, shareholders can still change their vote by voting theGREENproxy, as only the latest dated proxy will be counted at the meeting.FrontFour encourages shareholders to visit thewww.saverenegade.comwebsite andvote the12-digit control number found on your GREEN proxy FOR FrontFour, no later than 5:00 p.m. (Calgarytime) on January 23rd, 2014.For more information or assistance in voting yourGREENproxy, contact CST Phoenix Advisors toll-free at 1-866-822-1237 or by email atinquiries@phoenixadvisorscst.com.About FrontFour Capital Group LLCFounded in 2006, FrontFour is an investment management company with offices in Greenwich, Connecticut and Toronto, Ontario.Notice To United States ShareholdersThis solicitation of proxies is not subject to the requirements of Section 14(a) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"U.S. Exchange Act\").

However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders.The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the Rules adopted thereunder.

A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\").The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2013 will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.The following table provides information regarding the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates.Average Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ending 11/30/2013113.45%Current Fiscal Period's Annualized Distribution Rate on NAV26.33%Fiscal Year to Date (11/01/2013 to 11/30/2013)Cumulative Total Return on NAV1(3.06%)Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV20.53%1Return data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions\u00c2\u00a0reinvested at prices\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.2Based on the Fund's NAV as of November 30, 2013.While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.Pursuant to an exemptive order granted to the Fund by the Securities and Exchange Commission onMarch 30, 2010, the Fund may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Fund during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Fund, to be taxed at a lower long-term capital gains rate. If the total distributions made in any calendar year exceed investment company taxable income and net capital gain, such excess distributed amount would be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of the earnings and profits would first be a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the adjusted tax basis in the shares. After such adjusted tax basis is reduced to zero, the distribution would constitute capital gain (assuming the shares are held as capital assets).The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share.\u00c2\u00a0 The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold or hold securities that it would liquidate, for the purpose of paying the distribution.\u00c2\u00a0 The Distribution Policy may, under certain circumstances, cause the amounts of taxable distributions to exceed the levels required to be distributed under the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., to the extent the Fund has capital losses in any taxable year, such losses may be carried forward to reduce the amount of capital gains required to be distributed in future years; if distributions in a year exceed the amount minimally required to be distributed under the tax rules, such excess will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent loss carry-forwards reduce the required amount of capital gains distributions in that year).\u00c2\u00a0 The Fund's Board of Directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share.\u00c2\u00a0 Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.Circular 230 disclosure:\u00c2\u00a0 To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost.

Three sources, with ties to the leadership, said\nmore than a dozen officials of ranks equivalent to a cabinet\nminister or vice minister have been questioned since last year\nin connection with the case.The questioning will not necessarily lead to prosecution but\nthese investigations into the affairs of China's top leaders are\nunprecedented and highlight President Xi Jinping's determination\nto crack down on graft. Xi has warned that corruption, a major\nsource of discontent among China's people, is a threat to the\nparty's survival.While the probe does not risk a split in the party, as Zhou\ndoes not have a popular support base, he still has many\nloyalists in the country's security apparatus who benefited from\nhis patronage.The officials who were questioned have not been taken into\ncustody, but are barred from leaving the country, said the\nsources, who requested anonymity to avoid repercussions for\ndiscussing secretive elite politics.\"The special task force is trying to determine if the\nofficials broke the law or breached (party) discipline when they\ndid Zhou Yongkang's bidding,\" one source told Reuters.The officials include the country's top prosecutor Cao\nJianming and people in the security apparatus - the police force\nand civilian intelligence agency - that Zhou used to head, they\nsaid.Several lower-ranking Beijing city government officials as\nwell as anchors of state broadcaster CCTV have also been\nquestioned, the sources said.Zhou was a member of the party's Politburo Standing\nCommittee - the apex of power in the country - and held the\nimmensely powerful post of security tsar until he retired in\n2012.The government has yet to make any kind of official\nstatement about Zhou or the case against him and it has not been\npossible to contact him for comment.The cabinet spokesman's office, which doubles as the party's\npublic affairs office, the party's anti-corruption watchdog, the\nMinistry of Public Security, the Beijing city government and\nCCTV all did not respond to requests for comment.An official at the state prosecutor's general office, which\ndeals with media enquires, told Reuters by telephone that it\ncould not comment, saying such questions were within the\njurisdiction of the party's anti-corruption watchdog.DRASTIC MEDICINEXi told the party's anti-corruption watchdog on Tuesday that\nthe fight against graft was grim and complicated and that it had\nto be solved quickly with \"drastic medicine\".China has hailed the crackdown on corruption, saying \"new\nprogress and achievements\" had led to a 13.3 percent increase in\nthe number of people punished last year. But critics argue that\nlasting results are unlikely without meaningful political\nreform.Several of Zhou's men have been felled, including Jiang\nJiemin, briefly top regulator of state-owned enterprises, and\nformer Vice Minister of Public Security Li Dongsheng.Zhou himself has been put under virtual house arrest at a\nvilla in the northern port city of Tianjin, two of the sources\nsaid, adding that his bodyguards, secretaries and driver have\nbeen removed.He is being guarded by soldiers from the elite 38th Army and\ncannot receive guests, leave the villa or make phone calls\nwithout prior approval, the sources said, a sign the leadership\nis nervous about his lingering influence .\"Contact with the outside world has been totally cut off,\"\none of the sources said.While the Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for\ncomment on Zhou, the official People's Liberation Army Daily\nreminded soldiers last month of their duty to follow the party's\norders.\"Ensure that the barrel of the gun is firmly placed in the\nhands of people who are loyal to the party, ensure that the\nmilitary's thinking, politics and actions are always in step\nwith the party's centre, and resolutely uphold the authority of\nCentral Military Commission Chairman Xi,\" the daily said.Zhou's wife, one-time television reporter Jia Xiaoye, and\nhis eldest son from a previous marriage, Zhou Bin, are also\nunder investigation, the sources said. Zhou's second son, Zhou\nHan, has been spared.\"The special task force is trying to find out who tipped off\nZhou Bin about the issuance of a warrant for his arrest last\nyear,\" another source said.Zhou Bin fled to the United States earlier last year and\nthen went to Singapore, but returned to China after negotiations\nwith Chinese authorities, the source added.It was also not possible to reach any Zhou family members\nfor comment. It is not clear if any of them have lawyers.During his five-year watch as security chief, Zhou Yongkang\noversaw the police force, civilian intelligence apparatus,\nparamilitary police, judges and prosecutors. Government spending\non domestic security exceeded the defence budget.But Zhou became too powerful and that position was\ndowngraded during a sweeping leadership reshuffle in 2012.DEAL TRANSPARENTLYXi ordered the special task force formed late last year to\nlook into accusations brought against Zhou by political rivals,\nsources with leadership ties have said.In ordering the investigation, Xi broke with an unwritten\nunderstanding that members of the omnipotent Standing Committee\nwill not be investigated after retirement.It is unclear if the government will actually put Zhou on\ntrial and risk the possibility that embarrassing revelations\nabout China's elite become public knowledge, potentially further\naffecting public faith in the party.\"The party needs to deal with this transparently or risk\nundermining confidence in its fight against corruption,\" said a\nsource with ties to the military.Zhou was last seen at an alumni celebration at the China\nUniversity of Petroleum on Oct. 1.Zhou himself was a patron of the once high-flying politician\nBo Xilai, who was jailed for life in September for corruption\nand abuse of power - the worst political scandal since the 1976\ndownfall of the Gang of Four.Bo's career was stopped short last year by the attempted\ndefection of his estranged police chief who implicated Bo's wife\nin the murder of a British businessman over a business dispute.\nBo's wife and his former police chief have been convicted and\njailed.\n\n (Editing byRaju Gopalakrishnan)"], "2014/01/17/olympics-sweden-idUSL5N0KR20J20140117": ["UPDATE 3-Olympics-Stockholm pulls plug on 2022 Games bid", "2014/01/17", "* Stockholm cites financial concerns* Five cities left in 2022 Games race   (Updates with IOC reaction)STOCKHOLMJan 17 (Reuters) - Stockholm has surprisingly pulled the financial plug on its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics with the Swedish city's ruling Moderate party saying on Friday that investing in the Games was not attractive enough.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in November that six cities, including former summer Games hosts Beijing and Stockholm, had launched bids to stage the 2022 event.\"Arranging a Winter Olympics would mean a big investment in new sports facilities, for example for the bobsleigh and luge,\" the Moderate party said in a statement.\"There isn't any need for that type of that kind of facility after an Olympics.\"Norway capital Oslo, which hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics, is also among those in the running, along with Krakow in Poland, Kazakhstan's Almaty and Ukraine's Lviv.\"Although the calculations are well worked out, we estimate that revenues will likely be lower and costs higher than the investigation indicates,\" said Stockholm city council chairman and finance commissioner Sten Nordin.Next month's Winter Games at Russia's Sochi will have done little to make the event more attractive to potential bid cities with an overall price tag of more than $50 billion, more expensive than any previous summer or winter Games.The IOC played down the Swedish city's withdrawal from the bidding process, saying the field of candidates remained very strong.\"I note that those who took the decision made it absolutely clear that this was not a 'no' to any future bid,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.\"Indeed, I understand they remain strongly interested in staging the Games and are considering bidding again perhaps with a stronger bid for 2026.\"\"For the 2022 contest there remain five strong candidates and we look forward to a good contest to stage the Olympic Winter Games,\" Adams said.IOC President Thomas Bach, who took over from Jacques Rogge in September, has pledged to make the bidding process less bureaucratic and more attractive to future bid cities.Stockholm's refusal to back an Olympic bid is reminiscent of the Italian government pulling out of a bid by Rome for the 2020 Olympics two years ago over similar financial fears.Switzerland's St Moritz and Germany's Munich also briefly considered a run for the 2022 Games before financial concerns and local opposition led to them dropping their plans.\"With more time to the date of application, it is possible that finding other solutions might have been possible. Stockholm is a winter sports town and I am open to staging the Winter Olympics in the future,\" Nordin said.\"Unfortunately we are of the opinion that it's not realistic to make a bid for the 2022 Olympics,\" he said.

However, it exceeded the 32.9 percent turnout in a referendum that backed the previous Islamist-tinged constitution under Mursi in 2012.The new constitution, which won wide support from many Egyptians who favored Mursi's removal, could lead to an outright ban on Islamist parties and strengthens the political grip of the already powerful military establishment.BROTHERHOOD BOYCOTTMursi's Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist organization and faces a fierce security crackdown, boycotted the vote and accuses the army of having staged a military coup against Mursi.The army, Egypt's most powerful institution, said it was responding to the will of the people.Hundreds of Mursi's supporters were killed when security forces stormed Cairo protest camps calling for his reinstatement in August and thousands more have been arrested since then, accused of violence or terrorism.\"The referendum took place against a backdrop of arrests and detention of dissenting voices,\" Democracy International, which deployed foreign observers across Egypt to monitor the polls, said in a statement on Friday.\"There was no real opportunity for those opposed to the government's road map or the proposed constitution to dissent.\"The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the referendum results invalid in a statement posted on its official Facebook page.Cairo's main Western ally and military backer, the United States, has expressed concern for democracy since Mursi was ousted, but has also described Egypt, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, as a vital partner.\"Egypt's turbulent experiment in participatory democracy in the last three years has reminded us all that it's not one vote that determines a democracy, it's all the steps that follow,\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.\"... it's what comes next that will shape Egypt's political, economic and social framework for generations.\"YEARNING FOR CALMThe passing of the constitution reflects a widespread yearning for calm in the most populous Arab state, which has suffered from continual upheaval since a popular uprising toppled the ex-military autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.Mursi's opponents say the referendum will help to neutralize the Brotherhood, which had won every election since 2011 but became deeply unpopular after Mursi's year in office.\"The referendum is a blow that will expel them from the arena ... All those who go out in the streets must reassess. They cannot beat the will of 20 million,\" Deputy Prime Minister Hossam Eissa said on state television.Officials have said that supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are welcome to join the political process as long as they forswear violence and adopt the army-backed road map.\"The Brotherhood has a valuable chance to return to the heart of the nation and the first step is for them to admit that they are a part of Egypt,\" said Amr Moussa, head of the 50-member assembly that drafted the constitution.Seeing Sisi as front-runner for president, some members of the assembly drafting the constitution wanted the presidential ballot held before legislative polls or even at the same time, so that a strong presidential candidate could forge an electoral alliance for the parliamentary race.Interim President Adly Mansour is expected to announce within days whether presidential or parliamentary elections will take place first.(Reporting by Ahmad Tolba andAsma Alsharif; Editing byKevin Liffey)"], "2014/01/18/bkn-pistons-wizards-preview-idUSMTZEA1ILIRJ1I20140118": ["Preview: Pistons at Wizards", "2014/01/18", "The Washington Wizards are one win away from joining the rarified air as a winning team in the Eastern Conference.

U.N. Relief Works Agency spokesman Chris Gunness said it would feed just 330 of the camp's 18,000 residents for a month. It was not immediately clear how much aid made it through on Sunday.Cold War foes Moscow and Washington, which have emerged as the leading pro- and anti-Assad powers, have urged both parties to make concessions, including ceasefires, access for aid and prisoner exchanges, to build confidence before the conference.Russian news agency Itar-Tass cited Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying that the opposition Coalition had made \"a correct decision\" in agreeing to attend.\"We have been saying the entire time that it is necessary to go to the forum and enter into dialogue with the government.\"Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, on a visit to Moscow this month, said he had given Russian officials a plan for a truce in Aleppo, Syria's biggest city, and said the government was ready to swap lists of prisoners to be freed.But there is little sign of violence abating or of either side winning a final victory on the battlefield.Activists around the country, from the capital to Aleppo to the eastern province of Deir al-Zor on the border with Iraq, said that the Syrian air force was using jets and helicopters to bomb rebel-held areas.Rebel fighters from Syria's Qalamoun mountain range, near the border with Lebanon, said more than 60 opposition militants had been killed in an ambush by forces loyal to Assad on Sunday.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-Assad monitoring group, said that helicopters over Aleppo were using crudely-made and inaccurate \"barrel bombs\", which can collapse entire apartment blocks. It said 194 people had been killed on Saturday. Death tolls on such a scale have become almost routine as fighting has intensified in the past year.After two years when Western countries believed Assad's days were numbered and rebels seized whole swathes of the country, the past year has seen the war largely go the president's way.Rebels have fought each other, with groups turning against a powerful al Qaeda-linked Islamist faction. Assad's forces have recovered lost ground, and the rise of Islamists among the rebels has cost them Western support.A last-minute decision by Washington in September to scrap plans for strikes to punish Assad for using chemical arms effectively ended more than two years of speculation that the West might join the war against Assad, as it did in 2011 against Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Sunday that Assad had told Russian lawmakers he would not yield power. Syrian state media denied the quotes as \"not accurate\", however.It was not immediately clear why Damascus would object to a Russian agency reporting the president's defiant line. State media said later on Sunday that Assad had met Russian religious leaders and parliamentarians and called for an international effort to fight \"terrorists\", the label Damascus uses for the armed opposition.(Editing byPeter Graff; Additional reporting byThomas Grovein Moscow)"], "2014/01/19/bkn-celtics-magic-preview-idUSMTZEA1JNDFHIC20140119": ["Preview: Celtics at Magic", "2014/01/19", "All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo is back in the lineup as the Boston Celtics try to begin turning their fortunes around Sunday when they visit the struggling Orlando Magic.

Leading scorer Arron Afflalo scored 24 in his return to the lineup for Orlando after missing three outings with a foot injury.TV: 6 p.m. ET, CSN New England (Boston), FSN Florida (Orlando)ABOUT THE CELTICS (14-27): Rondo was limited to 19 minutes in his return, adding four assists and only one turnover, but should get more time against a tough Orlando backcourt. It will take time for Rondo to find a rhythm with backcourt mate Avery Bradley, who is second on the team in scoring (14.7) behind forward Jeff Green (15.6). Center Kelly Olynyk scored in double figures for the first time in January with a season-high 25 on Friday and forward Jared Sullinger is averaging 15.8 points and 11.6 rebounds in his last five outings.ABOUT THE MAGIC (10-30): Orlando continues to struggle inside with center Nikola Vucevic out of the lineup the last six games with a concussion and gave up 30 points to Charlotte center Al Jefferson on Friday. Former Celtic Glen Davis has played admirably, averaging 15.8 points and 8.7 rebounds the last half-dozen games at center, but Orlando is 0-12 overall without the 7-0 Vucevic in the lineup this season. Rookie of the Year candidate Victor Oladipo recorded his third double-double Friday with 11 points and 10 assists.BUZZER BEATERS1. Afflalo has led or shared the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scoring lead in 22 of his 36 outings and averages 20.9 points.2. Boston G Jerryd Bayless has scored in double figures off the bench three times in seven games since being acquired from Memphis.3.

He said he had counted 18 bodies after the shooting and many houses burned.A former local councilor, Mustapha Galtimare, who was on the scene after the attack, concurred with the numbers of dead.The village lies in remote northeastern Borno state, the epicenter of the insurgency and relic of Nigeria's oldest medieval Islamic caliphate, which once prospered from trans-Saharan trade routes passing though the largely Muslim north.Boko Haram is fighting to re-establish an Islamic kingdom in northern Nigeria, breaking away from the largely Christian south. Its fighters have killed thousands of people since they launched an uprising in mid-2009.\"They had been in the village for nearly two hours without any security personnel coming to the aid of the villagers,\" Ibrahim said.A military spokesman in Borno state, Colonel Muhammadu Dole, said he was aware of the attack but had no details.Jonathan declared a state of emergency in the northeast last May and ordered in extra troops and air strikes on Islamist bases. It appeared to quell the violence at first, but as is often the case, the insurgents reemerged from the shadows and are now more open in their targeting of civilians.Boko Haram remains the most serious security headache to Africa's top oil producer and second biggest economy, although the military offensive has squeezed them into smaller pockets along the Cameroon border.On December 2 Boko Haram gunmen stormed the air force base and military barracks around the airport of the northeastern city of Maiduguri. The group was also blamed for a car bomb in the city this week that killed 29 people.(Reporting by Ibrahim Mshelizza; Writing byTim Cocks; editing byRalph Boulton)"], "2014/01/20/idUSnMKW0x7nDa+1c2+MKW20140120": [0, "2014/01/20", "Teck's Q4 2013 Financial Results and Investors' Conference Call February 13, 2014VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jan 20, 2014) -Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") will release its fourth quarter 2013 earnings results on Thursday, February 13, 2014 before market open.The company will hold an investor conference call to discuss the fourth quarter 2013 earnings results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday, February 13, 2014.

As a \n      percentage of GDP, gross written premiums stood at 0.6% in 2012, as \n      compared to 3.5% for Morocco. The penetration of insurance products is \n      significantly lower than the average penetration rate of 1.5% recorded \n      in other Maghreb countries, suggesting that there is an opportunity for \n      growth. In addition, the Algerian government is planning large-scale \n      infrastructural investments which will require high-value insurance \n      cover. This is likely to be the key driver of growth in the Algerian \n      insurance industry over the forecast period (2013-2017). Algeria is one \n      of the largest oil and gas suppliers in the Maghreb region, and the \n      leading supplier to Europe.

It is nothing short of sickening. But this is the face of the new anti-Semitism,\" he said, prompting applause from the floor and heckles from two Arab-Israeli lawmakers, who then stormed out.Israel's 20 percent population of Arab citizens often say they are discriminated against and Israel has been accused by the Palestinians of employing an apartheid policy toward them.Most countries deem Israeli settlements in territories captured in 1967 illegal and international boycott campaigns against products made in Israeli enclaves in the occupied West Bank have rattled Israeli politicians.Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni said on local television at the weekend that Israel could face the sort of isolation imposed on apartheid South Africa.Harper in his speech echoed remarks by Israeli leaders who last week said the stance some Western countries were taking in the conflict was \"hypocritical\" and imbalanced.Canada has long backed Israel on the diplomatic stage, voting in 2012 against a Palestinian U.N. bid to win statehood and in the same year cutting ties with Iran.Palestinian official Nabil Shaath, in an op-ed published in the Canadian Globe and Mail on Monday, voiced disappointment over what Palestinians see as Harper's pro-Israel tilt.\"Mr. Harper will be able to say that he visited Mr. Abbas. But ... nobody else is asking to meet Mr. Harper.

Yet sales in thermal power still account for close to 45 percent of group revenue, against little over a quarter for transport.The power equipment takes years to install and usually comes with hefty downpayments that underpin cash flow at Alstom and its European rivals Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and ABB (ABBN.VX).Underlining the volatility of the business, Alstom has burned cash for half of the past decade, Reuters data shows. In an attempt to steady its finances, Kron pledged last year to cut 1.5 billion euros of annual costs by 2016.\"The expected deleveraging process was the main support to the shares, but is further postponed. Confidence is broken,\" Societe Generale analysts wrote in a note.Alstom shares were down 12.3 percent by 1408 GMT, close to a two-year low. The drop wiped more than 1 billion euros off its market value. Shares in Bouygues (BOUY.PA), Alstom's main shareholder with a 29 percent stake, fell 5.3 percent. Both were the biggest losers on France's CAC 40 index.FCHI.The dearth of large orders in thermal power comes as utilities delay spending in a weak global economy. In some European countries, government caps on electricity bills and competition from renewable energy have made traditional power stations fired by coal or gas less profitable.MARGIN SQUEEZEAlstom kept a full-year forecast of low single-digit sales growth from existing businesses, but said it expected its operating margin - a measure of profitability - to dip slightly to around 7 percent this year, before declining again in 2015.It had previously aimed for positive free cash flow for the year and a stable operating margin at 7.2 percent, which it would try to improve to 8 percent within three years.Alstom said in November it planned around 1,300 job cuts and said it would sell up to 2 billion euros of assets, including a minority stake in its transport unit, which makes France's prized high-speed TGV trains.That announcement was met with a cool response from the Socialist government, whose centre-right predecessor already bailed out Alstom when it ran into similar trouble a decade ago, stretching European competition rules to rescue a company seen as a champions of French industry alongside Peugeot (PEUP.PA) and EDF (EDF.PA).Nomura analyst Daniel Cunliffe said Alstom should forego a dividend and launch a share issue to fill the cash hole, or else it would have to sell an even bigger stake than planned in the transport unit, further squeezing future earnings.\"Do a rights issue, cut the dividend - the only person you'll annoy is Bouygues and you'll keep the family silver which is the transport business,\" Cunliffe said.In the third quarter, the transport unit booked a record 2.57 billion euros in orders, driven by a 1.2 billion contract to equip Riyadh's subway, helping offset a 4 percent drop in orders in thermal power.The last time Alstom shares fell by as much in one day was in May, when it cut its sales forecast for the next three years, saying customers were delaying projects.The month after, Moody's lowered Alstom's long-term credit rating to Baa3, one notch above \"junk\". Standard & Poor's, which rates Alstom BBB, also said it may downgrade its debt.Kron insisted in November there was no need to ask shareholders for more capital and on Tuesday did not mention such a scenario. He said he was confident the company would raise up to 2 billion euros by asset sales. And he saw no need to renegotiate debt covenants.Group orders stood at 5.62 billion euros in the quarter, up 11 percent from a year ago. Nine-month sales fell 1 percent to 14.53 billion and were up 3 percent on an organic basis.(Editing byTom PfeifferandDavid Holmes)"], "2014/01/21/idUSnMKWZr81ya+1e0+MKW20140121": [0, "2014/01/21", "NuPathe Terminates Agreement With Endo and Enters Into Agreement to Be Acquired by TevaMALVERN, PA--(Marketwired - Jan 21, 2014) -NuPathe Inc.(NASDAQ:PATH) today announced that it has terminated its agreement and plan of merger with Endo Health Solutions Inc. and its Board has withdrawn its recommendation that stockholders accept Endo's offer to acquire all outstanding shares of NuPathe common stock.

Aorato's Directory Services Application Firewall is a unique solution for a very important part of enterprise infrastructure, and the founders' cyber-security expertise is second to none.\"Aorato's approach is to focus on Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) services activities by observing the network traffic between AD servers and the active network entities (users, devices etc.). The technology uses the interactions identified in this traffic to create the Organizational Security Graph[TM](OSG), a model of the observed relationships over time. Aorato monitors AD traffic comparing activities against the OSG model looking for anomalies that could represent attack behavior or security policy violations (e.g., cleartext/simple passwords, AD protocols violations, deleted/disabled users /computers activities etc.). The DAF alerts on suspicious activities inserting them into an Attack TimelineTM, providing security professionals with the needed means to identify the steps in the attack chain from the seemingly harmless individual events.\"In today's world of persistent threats, malicious insiders, and Single Sign On leveraging account access, paying attention to Directory Services' activity is key to an organizations' security. \u00c2\u00a0Aorato's creation of the Directory Services Application Firewall and OSG to focus on Active Directory provides a new level of needed insight within enterprises,\" saidDavid Monahan, Research Director, Enterprise Management Associates.Aorato's advisory board includes:Gil Kilkpatrick:Gil Kilpatrickis a Microsoft MVP for Directory Services from 2005 and was the Chief Architect of Quest Software for Active Directory and identity management solutions.

Combining the company's intimate knowledge of Active Directory and cyber-security, Aorato has filled in this blind spot with their Directory Services Application Firewall (DAF). DAF protects Active Directory and leverages its central role in the network to protect organizations from advanced targeted threats. DAF automatically learns the behaviors of all entities engaging directly, or indirectly, with Active Directory. By profiling the entities, DAF builds an interaction graph between all entities in order to detect in real-time suspicious entity behavior.

These targets exhibit a gravity high in the absence of the magnetic response that is characteristic of magnetite.This process has resulted in IMX prioritising the Axehead prospect (Figures 2 and 3) for further detailed gravity surveys. This is expected to be concluded and the results analysed within a fortnight.IMX expects to begin drilling Axehead in February once the additional ground gravity results are assessed. Further ground gravity will also be carried out on the other prospects that have been identified.Axehead is located near to the DSO magnetite operations currently in production at IMX's Cairn Hill Mine.The close proximity of Axehead to Cairn Hill means that any DSO hematite discovery could be brought into production relatively quickly by accessing the road, rail and port infrastructure used for the Cairn Hill Mine.Axehead and the other prospects that have been identified sit within the Mt Woods Inlier, which is an extremely iron-rich geological terrain that hosts Arrium Mining's Peculiar Knob direct shipping hematite mine. Axehead lies just 20km from Peculiar Knob (Figure 1).IMX Acting Managing Director John Nitschke said the initial gravity survey results supported the Company's belief that hematite may occur in association with the magnetite at Mt Woods.\"We are excited about the potential for DSO hematite at Axehead and the surrounding Mt Woods tenement.\"Hematite is known to occur in our magnetite prospects and it is currently being produced from the nearby Peculiar Knob project owned by Arrium,\" Mr Nitschke said.\"Hematite is abundant in the broader Gawler Craton region of South Australia having been mined since early last century in the Middleback Ranges and is the focus of active exploration by a number of other companies.\"The presence of economic hematite nearby, combined with the early results of our exploration, supports our view that there is strong potential for DSO hematite at Axehead and the surrounding Mt Woods tenements.\" Mr Nitschke said. \"We look forward to the results of ongoing gravity work and initial drilling at Axehead.\"JOHN NITSCHKE, Acting Managing DirectorTo viewFigure 1, please visit the following link:http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/IMX_Figure1.pdf.To viewFigures 2 and 3,please visit the following link:http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/IMX_fig2-3.pdf.About IMX Resources LimitedIMX Resources Limited is an Australian-based mining and exploration company, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX') and Toronto Stock Exchange, with projects located in Australia and East Africa.In Australia, IMX operates and owns 51% of the Cairn Hill Mining Operation, located 55km south-east of Coober Pedy in South Australia, where it produces a premium coarse-grained magnetite-copper-gold DSO product at a rate of 1.8Mtpa. This operation generates cash flow which underpins the IMX investment proposition.IMX is also actively exploring for direct shipping hematite at its Mt Woods tenements, located near the Cairn Hill Mining Operation, and progressing development options for its Mt Woods Magnetite Project. Studies indicate that a smaller scale, lower cost project may be developed utilising existing infrastructure already in use at the Cairn Hill Mining Operation. Efforts to secure a partner to support development of the Mt Woods Magnetite Project are continuing.In Africa, IMX owns the highly prospective Ntaka Hill Nickel Sulphide Project, located within the broader 7,000km2Nachingwea Exploration Project in south-eastern Tanzania which is prospective for nickel and copper sulphide, gold and graphite mineralization.

The major opportunities in \n      the market are value-based medicine and personalized medicine.The global market is propelled by the increasing demand for better \n      clinical outcomes, treatment of diseases in the early stages, and rise \n      in efficiency of the healthcare process. A major driver is the American \n      Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which offers incentives to \n      hospitals and physicians that adopt electronic health records (EHRs) \n      technology and document Meaningful Use.' Healthcare analytics also helps \n      in decision-making and handling large amounts of data generated in \n      healthcare. The major barriers for the market, however, are the mindset \n      of physicians, operational gap between payers and providers, and lack of \n      trained IT staff in healthcare.The global market is dominated by the US, followed by Europe, Asia, and \n      the Rest of the World. The U.S. will continue to lead the global market \n      till 2020.

One of the key factors contributing to this market \n      growth is the growing need to reduce capital and operational \n      expenditure. The market has also been witnessing increased adoption of \n      virtualized infrastructure. However, increasing complexity of network \n      infrastructure, which is limiting end-to-end solutions, could pose a \n      challenge to the growth of this market.The key vendors dominating this market space include AT&T Inc., Digital \n      Realty Trust, Equinix Inc., Level3 Communications Inc., Rackspace Inc., \n      Savvis Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc.The other vendors mentioned in the report are Abovenet, BT Global \n      Services, Cervalis, Cogent, Computer Science Corp., CoreSite Realty \n      Corp., Datapipe, Dupont Fabros Technology, Global Switch Holdings Ltd., \n      GoGrid, Hosting.com, IBM Corp., Internap, Interxion Holding, Navisite, \n      Sabey Corp., Sungard Availability Services, Telecity group, and \n      Telehouse.Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Data Centers team said: \n      Virtualization is being widely adopted by enterprises and data center \n      service providers. Due to the increasing digital content in enterprise \n      networks and growing complexity of network infrastructure, there is a \n      growing demand for high-performance computing systems. Enterprises are \n      opting for virtualized infrastructure, which enables them to get the \n      maximum throughput from the equipment. Colocation service providers are \n      also adopting virtualized infrastructure to cater to the growing demands \n      from end-users. With virtualization of the infrastructure, colocation \n      service vendors are also able to make operational cost savings, which in \n      turn reduces the costs associated with the adoption of colocation \n      services.For more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/nhftvn/global_dataAbout Research and MarketsResearch and Markets is the world's leading source for international \n      market research reports and market data.

Management uses EBIT to evaluate Woodward's operating performance without the impacts of financing and tax related considerations.\u00c2\u00a0Management uses EBITDA in evaluating Woodward's operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios.\u00c2\u00a0Management uses free cash flow, which is derived from net cash provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant, and equipment, in reviewing the financial performance of Woodward's various business segments and evaluating cash generation levels.\u00c2\u00a0Securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flow in their evaluation of companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortization.\u00c2\u00a0The use of any of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\u00c2\u00a0Because EBIT and EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded.\u00c2\u00a0Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Management's calculations of EBIT, EBITDA, and free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Conference CallWoodward will hold an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST, January 21, 2014 to provide an overview of the financial performance for the first quarter, business highlights, and outlook for fiscal 2014.\u00c2\u00a0You are invited to listen to the live webcast of our conference call, or a recording, and view or download accompanying presentation slides at our website,www.woodward.com.You may also listen to the call by dialing 1-866-793-1344 (domestic) or 1-703-639-1315 (international).\u00c2\u00a0Participants should call prior to the start time to allow for registration; the Conference ID is 1630063.\u00c2\u00a0An audio replay will be available by telephone from 7:30 p.m. EST on January 21, 2014 until 11:59 p.m. EST on February 4, 2014.\u00c2\u00a0The telephone number to access the replay is 1-888-266-2081 (domestic) or 1-703-925-2533 (international), reference access code 1630063.A webcast presentation will be available on the website by clicking the Investors tab, then the Calendar of Events menu selection and associated webcast link.\u00c2\u00a0The call and presentation will remain accessible at the website for 14 days.About Woodward, Inc.Woodward is an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solutions for the aerospace and energy markets.\u00c2\u00a0The company's innovative fluid, combustion, electrical, and motion control systems help customers offer cleaner, more reliable, and more efficient equipment.\u00c2\u00a0Our customers include leading original equipment manufacturers and end users of their products.\u00c2\u00a0Woodward is a global company headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.

The report strives to elaborate \n      on the demand and supply characteristics of catalysts by providing \n      historical data from 2009 and a forecast of market numbers until 2018 \n      along with analysis of revenues and volumes.The chemical compound catalyst market is further segmented into \n      polyolefins, adsorbents, chemical synthesis catalysts and others. The \n      catalysts market by application is divided among the four major segments \n      of environmental, chemical synthesis, petroleum refining and polymers. \n      Of these the environmental segment is expected to be the leading market \n      in the world and holds sway over chemical synthesis and the other two \n      segments.Heterogeneous catalysts are increasing in importance with uses in \n      automotive, chemical, polymer, refinery and stationary industry and are \n      found to be the major market segment globally in the catalysts market. \n      Homogeneous catalysts are also growing in popularity owing to their \n      unique features such as selectivity, high activity and varied \n      application. Ever rising prices of raw materials is forcing refiners to \n      go in for catalyst regeneration, which costs 30% to 50% less than fresh \n      catalysts. Moreover, catalyst regeneration helps refiners to deal with \n      the problem of land filling.Key Topics Covered:1 Preface2 Executive Summary3 Market Overview4 Catalysts Market by Material5 Catalysts Market By Application6 Catalysts Market By Type7 Catalysts Regeneration Market8 Catalysts Market By Geography9 Company ProfilesCompanies Mentioned:Air Products and Chemicals IncorporatedAlbemarle CorporationArkema GroupBASF SEChevronClariant International Ltd.E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont)Eka Chemicals ABEvonik Industries AGExxon Mobil CorporationINEOS Group LimitedJohnson Matthey PLCUOP LLC.W.

Christie seeks road to bipartisanship", "2014/01/21", "TRENTON, New Jersey(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie turned to themes of small but compassionate government and bipartisan cooperation in his second inaugural address on Tuesday, making no direct mention of the abuse of power charges facing his administration.A charismatic and tough-talking fiscal conservative, Christie is widely seen as a Republican contender for the White House in 2016.Although he cruised to re-election in November, Christie has gone on the defensive in recent weeks amid allegations that his top aides orchestrated massive traffic snarls to exact political revenge and that his administration withheld Superstorm Sandy relief money to pressure a local mayor into approving a development deal.In his address in the state capital of Trenton after he was sworn into his second term, Christie returned to the themes that have been hallmarks of his political brand and criticized the idea that an \"almighty government\" can \"fix any problem.\"\"I do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government that penalizes success and then gives the pittance left to a few in the name of income equity,\" Christie said.Christie also returned to a subject common to his speeches: the need for Republicans and Democrats to work together.\"We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, DC ... The attitude that puts political victories ahead of policy agreements. The belief that compromise is a dirty word,\" said Christie. \"As your governor, I will always be willing to listen, as long as that listening ends in decisive action for the people who are counting on us to do our job.\"State Senate President Steve Sweeney, a top Democrat, said the speech was \"long on rhetoric and short on solutions\" and called for Christie's support for an earned income tax credit and higher taxes for the state's top earners.\"The governor delivered a nice speech today, but the working families of New Jersey deserve real results,\" Sweeney said in a statement.A POLITICAL TEMPESTChristie's second term begins amid a tempest -- an area snowstorm forced the cancellation of his inaugural party Tuesday evening on Ellis Island -- as well as a political storm that began this month over a traffic-related scandal.Emails released just weeks ago seemed to show that aides deliberately snarled traffic in Fort Lee, New Jersey, by closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey and New York.The lane closures appeared to be retribution against Fort Lee's Democratic mayor, who declined to endorse Christie for re-election.Christie has said he did not know of his aides' plans, and he fired and cut ties with them after their roles were revealed. Federal prosecutors and both chambers of the state legislature are investigating the lane closings, which occurred without notice for four days in September.In a sign the scandal is taking a toll on Christie's image, a Quinnipiac University poll found that just 35 percent of registered voters said he would make a good president, compared to almost half who voiced that opinion two months ago.\"New Jersey Governor Christopher Christie's 2016 presidential drive is stuck in traffic,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.Three-quarters of the voters surveyed had heard of the traffic scandal, and half said it would damage Christie's 2016 White House hopes. The poll of 1,933 registered voters was conducted from January 15 to January 19, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.The scandal broke two months after Christie, who has built a political reputation on his blunt-spoken manner and his success in getting his agenda through a heavily Democratic state, easily won re-election.Democrats have since raised other accusations. Last week, Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, a Democrat and frequent Christie ally, claimed the governor's administration had linked the release of Superstorm Sandy relief funds to approval of a Hoboken development project.Zimmer has said Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno warned her that Christie would withhold recovery funding if Zimmer did not support a bid by the New York-based Rockefeller Group to build on several blocks in the city.Christie's spokesman over the weekend dismissed the Hoboken mayor's claims as false, as did Guadagno.Federal officials are also reviewing Christie's use of about $2 million in storm relief funds for a tourism campaign that features him and his family. New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone requested the probe, saying he was concerned about the bidding process for the marketing campaign.A spokesman for Christie said there was nothing improper about the campaign and suggested Pallone's inquiry was politically motivated.(Writing byEdith Honan; Editing byEllen Wulfhorstand Amanda Kwan)"], "2014/01/21/ma-sentient-jet-idUSnBw216297a+100+BSW20140121": ["Sentient Jet Reports 2013 Best Year since 2008", "2014/01/21", "Sentient Jet Reports 2013 Best Year since 2008Celebrates Increased Growth, Recent Website Launch and Enhanced \n      Cardholder BenefitsSentient Jet, a Directional Aviation Capital company, today announced \n      that 2013 was recorded as its best year since 2008.

It is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.While shares might seem expensive at first glance at more than 20x forward earnings, relative to its peers and its growth projections, it seems reasonably priced. If Natus can continue to deliver better-than-expected financial results, then there is still plenty of upside left in the stock.Natus Medical Incorporated provides healthcare products used for the screening, detection, treatment, monitoring, and tracking of common medical ailments in newborn care, hearing impairment, neurological dysfunction, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and balance and mobility disorders. Its products address two primary end markets: Neurology and Newborn Care.OnJanuary 13, Natus Medical announced bullish guidance for 2014.Bear of the Day:SinceTexas Industries(NYSE:TXI-Free Report) reported its fiscal 2014 second quarter results, consensus estimates have fallen for both this year and next.

The failure of Wii U coupled with lower expectation for 3DS dragged down shares by 17.0%($3.06)to close at$14.90onJan 17, 2014.Nintendo recently revised down the full-year 2014 guidance citing lower Wii U and 3DS sales in the international markets. Despite a price cut prior to the holiday season, Wii U failed to gain any traction in the U.S. andEurope. Management slashed unit sales expectation by 70.0% to 2.8 million from an earlier projection of 9 million.Despite being in the market for a much longer period thanMicrosoft's(Nasdaq:MSFT-Free Report)andSony's(NYSE:SNE-Free Report)next-generation consoles, Wii U's failure indicates growing preference for smartphones and tablets as well as lack of compelling gaming titles on the platform.SinceNov 2012, Nintendo sold 5.3 million units of Wii U, compared with Sony's 4.4 million PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's 3.1 million Xbox One, which were released inNov 2013. The fast growth in both the consoles was also driven by the availability of premier titles such asBattlefield 4andCall of Duty: Ghosts.Nintendo's flagship 3DS sales also faltered by a significant margin in the U.S. andEurope, partially offset by strong growth inJapan. Per NPD data, 3DS was the top-selling hardware platform (in terms of unit) in U.S. in 2013. However, actual sales were well short of management's expectations.InEurope,Francewas the only country where 3DS reported strong sales. As per Nintendo, sales in other countries lagged management's expectations by a massive range. Nintendo revised down 3DS unit sales expectation to 13.5 million from a prior outlook of 18.0 million.These revisions are expected to negatively impact full-year 2014 revenues by330 billion yen. Higher manufacturing costs, increasing advertising expense (up by8 billion yen) and research & development expense (up by15 billion yen) will negatively impact operating profit by35 billion yen.The dismal performance of Wii U has made its future uncertain. We believe that the comparatively better performance by 3DS might compel Nintendo to put Wii U on the backburner.Get today's Zacks #1 Stock of the Day with your free subscription to Profit from the Pros newsletter:About the Bull and Bear of the DayEvery day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.About the Analyst BlogUpdated throughout every trading day, theAnalyst Blogprovides analysis from Zacks Equity Research about the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Business leaders gathering for their annual high-profile networking forum in Davos are feeling a bit better about their companies' prospects and a lot more so about the broader economic outlook.But they still have a long list of worries.Half a decade on from a financial crisis that brought the world economy to the brink, the immediate threats to corporate profits are receding and chief executives are encouraged by a brightening outlook in both the United States and Europe.Yet they do not have to look far for future threats - from a worrisome slowdown in emerging markets to uncertainty over the tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus and concerns over increased regulation.The annual PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) survey of more than 1,300 CEOs found that 39 percent were \"very confident\" their company's revenues would grow in 2014, up from 36 percent a year ago.While the trend is encouraging, the reading is still down on the 50 percent-plus levels seen in 2007 and 2008, highlighting how the return to growth remains fragile and uncertain.Significantly, CEOs were more upbeat in assessing the macro-economic outlook than that of their own companies, with 44 percent now believing the global economy will improve in the next 12 months against just 18 percent a year ago.The difference reflects the fact that economic issues are not the only ones weighing on executives' minds, according to Dennis Nally, the chairman of PwC International, who presented the findings on the eve of the January 22-25 World Economic Forum.\"Even though there is a higher degree of optimism about the global economy, there are still some pretty big challenges elsewhere to do with the volatility of certain economies, concerns around regulation and shifts in technology,\" he said.In fact, concerns about over-regulation have moved to the top of the agenda in the past year as new rules - many of which have been debated since 2008 - are now being implemented, raising the cost of compliance and taking up management time.EMERGING PROBLEMSThe weakness in some emerging markets and uncertainties about where this leaves corporate strategies is a big talking-point for many multinational companies, since it coincides with recovery in the West and signs of progress in Japan's efforts to counter years of economic stagnation.In response, a number of CEOs are turning back to advanced economies for growth, with the United States, Germany and Britain now seen as more promising than previous high-flyers such as India and Brazil.Nally said the trend was a key \"headline\" for Davos 2014 - a view shared by other pundits converging on the Swiss ski resort for four days of high-level discussions and networking.Economies considered \"dull and old\" like the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan will actually turn out to be the new locomotives of growth in 2014, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS.The emerging economies, by contrast, are losing steam as a commodities \"super-cycle\" - which has buoyed the likes of Brazil and Russia - wanes and political uncertainties grow ahead of 2014 elections in Turkey, South Africa, India, Indonesia and Brazil.\"Business leaders are generally feeling better about the developed markets and the prospects for the next couple of years but are worried about certain emerging markets, perhaps even to the point of curtailing some investment,\" said Barry Salzberg, global CEO of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.Other issues keeping top managers awake at night include concerns about fiscal deficits, increasing tax burdens, the availability of talent to fill key jobs, exchange rate volatility and unstable capital markets, the PwC survey found.The prevailing business mood paints a improving picture for job prospects, with half of CEOs interviewed worldwide expecting to add to staff in 2014, versus 45 percent a year ago.But that modest pick-up in hiring plans may not do much to dent chronic unemployment levels in many countries.Worldwide unemployment hit nearly 202 million in 2013, an increase of some 5 million compared with a year earlier, according to a report from the International Labour Organization on Tuesday.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Graphic on CEO confidence:link.reuters.com/qyh26v^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>(Editing byJeremy Gaunt)"], "2014/01/22/ny-horatio-alger-idUSnPnPHlQ1vW+169+PRN20140122": ["Horatio Alger Association Presents the Debut Performance of its International Ambassador, George Perris, at Jazz at Lincoln Center", "2014/01/22", "NEW YORK,Jan. 22, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, Inc., a nonprofit educational organization honoring the achievements of outstanding individuals and encouraging youth to pursue their dreams through higher education, presents, in partnership withForbes\u00c2\u00a0magazine, \"George PerrisLive at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\" This marks the first-ever performance for Mr. Perris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Association's international ambassador \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the famed venue.The 90-minute concert, \u00c2\u00a0which is in the process of being finalized for broadcast on both Comcast network and the Ovation channel, kicks-offHoratio Alger's2014 \"State of the Association\" meetings, which are being organized in celebration of the Association's awarding more than$100 millionin need-based scholarships since the inception of its National Scholarship Program in 1984.

Sacramento is a modest 5-5 in January but perhaps a tilt with Houston is just what the Kings need to get rolling after two wins in as many tries against the Rockets so far this season. Led by Rudy Gay, who tied a career high with 41 points, Sacramento halted a two-game skid in New Orleans on Tuesday.Houston, which has won two straight and seven of its last nine, is looking to atone for its pair of losses to the Kings earlier this season. \"We have played so awful against them this year,\" forward Chandler Parsons told the Houston Chronicle. \"They are a tough team.

Strategy-wise, Kings coach Michael Malone told The Sacramento Bee his club tries to do the simple things. \"To me, good offense is all about timing, spacing, setting screens, using screens. A lot of times, our spacing is poor, which makes it hard for the guy that we're trying to feature.\" That featured player on Tuesday was clearly Gay, who drained 16-of-25 from the field, including 5-of-8 3-pointers in his finest game since coming to Sacramento in a December deal with Toronto.ABOUT THE ROCKETS (28-15): Center Dwight Howard echoed Parsons' sentiments about his club's previous performances against the Kings this season, saying, \"We were so terrible in those games.\" Houston was anything but terrible in Monday's decision over Portland that featured a season-high 31 points from Parsons. \"The guys did a great job getting me the ball early,\" said Parsons, who rebounded from matching a season-low with eight points against Milwaukee on Saturday. \"Any time I get going early, I feel like I can have a big game,\" added the third-year pro.BUZZER BEATERS1.

Non-interest expenses, while higher than the sequential\nquarter due to \nincreased compensation, professional services, and marketing\nexpenses, were \nstill reasonable as they equated to a still good 54.9%\nefficiency ratio.\nFitch continues to note that USB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s main competitive advantages\nare its low cost \nfunding advantage, which allows it a pricing advantage in\nwinning new lending \nrelationships, and its overall low cost structure, which has\nhelped to support \nreturns during the challenging low interest rate environment\nover the last few \nyears.\nUSB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s average loans grew 1.5% from the sequential quarter and\n5.7% from the \nyear-ago quarter. The growth was primarily in commercial loan\nbalances, \nconstruction and development loans, higher on balance sheet\nresidential \nmortgages, and high auto loan balances, all partially offset\ncontinued \nreductions in covered loans. Fitch would expect some additional\nincremental loan \ngrowth for USB over the course of the next year.\nCredit quality continues to be very strong with both the\nnon-performing asset \n(NPA) ratio excluding covered loans and the net charge-off ratio\n(NCO) \ncontinuing to decline. In 4Q\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a213 the NPA ratio excluding\ncovered assets declined \nto 0.80%, and the NCO ratio declined to 0.53% of average loans.\nFitch continues \nto believe that overall credit quality is likely nearing or at a\ncyclical \ntrough, and that there will be some reversion in USB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s credit\nquality metrics \nover a medium-term time horizon. Fitch also expects USB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s\ncredit quality at that \ntime to be better than most industry peers.\nGiven the slow growth macro environment which has constrained\nloan growth, USB \ncontinues to actively return capital to owners via dividends and\nshare buybacks. \nIn 4Q\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a213, USB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s total payout ratio was 65%, which was lower\nthan the 77% in \n3Q\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a213, but still on the higher side. Fitch would expect the\npayout ratio to \nremain on the high side without opportunities for meaningful\nloan growth or \nacquisitions.\nUSB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s capital position remains sound, particularly given its\nstrong capital \ngeneration ability.

(\"RPA\"), who are independent \"qualified persons\" as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\u00c2\u00a0Significantly, the Technical Report highlights a large and discrete graphite deposit with an estimated Mineral Resource which is relatively insensitive to cut-off grades from 0.4% Cg up to at least 2.0% Cg.\u00c2RPA estimates Indicated Mineral Resources delineated to date total 25.1 million tonnes (\"Mt\") at an average grade of 3.89% graphitic carbon (\"Cg\"), containing 977,000 tonnes of Cg.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources delineated to date are estimated to total 20.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.20% Cg, containing 441,000 tonnes of Cg. These results are based on a cut-off grade of 0.6% Cg with an assumed market price of $8,500 per tonne Cg.\u00c2\u00a0The results below, as given in the Technical Report, show that even if the assumed market price of Cg varies, any appropriate increase in the cut-off grade results in a relatively minor reduction of the resource estimate.Classification,TonnageGradeTonnes Graphitic CarbonCut-off Grade(Mt)(%Cg)(t Cg)Indicated\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c22.020.74.41914,000\u00c21.024.33.99971,000\u00c20.625.13.89977,000\u00c20.425.43.85978,000Inferred\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c22.09.43.34315,000\u00c21.015.92.57408,000\u00c20.620.12.20441,000\u00c20.423.01.98455,000It is emphasised that the Technical Report defines a preliminary pit shell to fulfill the NI 43-101 requirement of \"reasonable prospects for economic extraction\".\u00c2\u00a0The economic potential and mining plans of these Mineral Resources will be determined in the upcoming Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) including more detailed definition of mining methods, pit slopes, costs and price assumptions.Aubrey Eveleigh, President and CEO of Zenyatta noted, \"The significance of the insensitive nature of the Mineral Resource to varying cut-off grades highlights the distinct and continuous occurrence of graphite mineralization within well-defined breccia pipes that were not particularly dependent on cut-off grades related to commodity price assumptions.\" Aubrey Eveleigh further commented \"Not only is a NI 43-101 Mineral Resource an important confirmation of a significant and unique graphite discovery, but the completion of the Technical Report required the input of a number of skilled and competent professionals.\u00c2\u00a0We are extremely pleased with quality of work represented by the report, and now look forward to the completion of a PEA\".Mr. Peter Wood, P.Geo., Zenyatta Ventures Ltd., Vice President Exploration, is the \"Qualified Person\" under National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

The next hearing is on March 25.The prosecutor described how Law had maltreated several former domestic helpers including 23-year-old Indonesian Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, who is now recovering from injuries in a hospital in Sragen, central Java.\"She began hitting her non-stop, she scratched her, slapped her and pushed her head against the wall and punched her nose and teeth,\" the prosecutor said.The court also heard how Erwiana and other former domestic helpers had been hit with various objects including clothes hangers and mops. Law threatened to kill their relatives if they disclosed the abuse, the prosecution said.Doctors treating Erwiana say burns on her body were caused by boiling water. Grisly photographs of her battered face and body circulating online have sparked accusations of \"modern-day slavery\".Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono wrote on his official twitter account that he would help settle legal issues and medical treatment for Erwiana, describing her ordeal as \"torture\".\"I am sad and concerned about the disaster your daughter, Erwiana, has had to face,\" Yudhoyono told the woman's father on Tuesday, according to the president's office.\"I'm also angry at those who commit these crimes and I want the law and justice to be enforced... So far, the handling of Indonesian workers (in Hong Kong) has been good but this disaster has happened... What's important is that you know the government is not happy, I am not happy.\"No plea was entered, but defense lawyer Patrick Wong in mitigation said Law had cooperated fully with police, had no criminal background and that there was no clear evidence of abuse except the claims made by the helpers.\"She is a typical, normal Hong Kong citizen whose roots are in Hong Kong,\" Wong said.Law left court wearing a black hood, sunglasses and surgical mask, followed by a scrum of reporters.Erwiana's plight has sparked protests and mounting community concern in Hong Kong.Several thousand domestic workers and supporters marched on Hong Kong's government headquarters on Sunday demanding a strong official response, justice and compensation for Erwiana.Hong Kong, a former British territory that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has around 300,000 foreign domestic helpers, most of them from the Philippines and Indonesia.(Additional reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor in Indonesia; Editing byNick Macfie)"], "2014/01/22/davos-egypt-investment-idUSL5N0KW1IW20140122": ["Dubai retailer MAF says to invest $2.3 bln in Egypt", "2014/01/22", "DAVOS, SwitzerlandJan 22 (Reuters) - Dubai retail group\nMajid Al Futtaim plans to invest about $2.3 billion\nin Egypt over the next few years, its chief executive said on\nWednesday, in a sign of Gulf investors' growing interest in the\nEgyptian economy.\"Total investments on the plan, including Carrefour, should\nbe around 16 billion Egyptian pounds over the next four to five\nyears,\" Iyad Malas told Reuters on the sidelines of the World\nEconomic Forum in Davos.MAF, the sole franchisee of Carrefour hypermarkets\nin the Middle East, will expand one of its shopping malls in\nCairo's Maadi district at a cost of 3.2 billion pounds, and\nbegin construction next week of another mall next to Cairo's\nmain airport that will cost a similar amount, Malas said.In addition, the company expects to complete construction of\nits 'Mall of Egypt' project near Cairo by the end of 2015 at a\ncost of 4.9 billion pounds, while the Carrefour operation plans\nfurther investments, he said."], "2014/01/22/singaporeexchange-results-statement-idUSL3N0KW17N20140122": ["Singapore Exchange Q2 net profit falls, derivatives grow", "2014/01/22", "SINGAPOREJan 22 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd\n reported net profit of S$75 million ($58.58 million)\nin the December quarter, its weakest in more than a year after a\npenny stock scandal hammered trading volumes.That came in line with the S$75.2 million average forecast\nof eight analysts surveyed by Reuters, and down 1.8 percent from\na year ago.Derivatives revenue rose 16 percent to S$52.5 million and\nwas a shade higher than securities revenue which fell 13 percent\nto S$52.2 million.Since taking over as CEO four years ago, Magnus Bocker has\nspearheaded the launch of new financial and commodity\nderivatives to make Singapore a regional gateway in Asia.The derivatives segment contributed 32 percent to SGX's\ntotal revenue in Oct-Dec, up from 28 percent a year ago.

So we have to transform animosities into friendship.\"An interim deal with six major powers including the United\nStates to restrict Iran's disputed nuclear programme in exchange\nfor a partial easing of economic sanctions entered into force\nthis week.Rouhani travelled to Davos to persuade foreign investors to\nreturn to his country, which has some of the world's biggest oil\nand gas resources and a market of 76 million people.In the interview, in which he spoke in Farsi voiced over\ninto French, he said relations with Washington had been\ndifficult in the past but with hard work and efforts by both\nsides, problems could be overcome.\"This effort is necessary to create confidence on both\nsides. Iran is in fact stretching out its hand in peace and\nfriendship to all countries of the world and wants friendly,\ngood relations with all countries in the world,\" the president\nsaid.SCEPTICAL ON SYRIAHe made no mention of the more difficult negotiations that\nlie ahead to conclude a permanent agreement on Iran's nuclear\nprogramme, which the West believes is aimed at developing \nweapons.However, he poured cold water on a U.N.-sponsored peace\nconference on the civil war in Syria, which opened in Montreux,\nSwitzerland on Wednesday in the absence of Iran, a key ally of\nDamascus, which was excluded after refusing to endorse the goal\nof a transition from President Bashar al-Assad's rule.\"Reaching a conclusion will be very difficult but my wish is\nthat if all efforts go in the direction of the wishes of the\nSyrian people, that is the direction that should prevail.\"\"As to whether this conference can achieve its objectives, I\nhave a lot of doubt,\" he added. Rouhani accused Saudi Arabia and\nQatar of backing \"terrorists\" in Syria in an effort to extend\ntheir own influence in the Middle East.Rouhani will give a short speech on Thursday to chief\nexecutives from oil majors such as Eni, BP,\nTotal and Shell, according to several\nexecutives who meet in Davos.Heads of U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil could also\nattend, the executives said.Tehran wants Western oil companies to revive its giant\nageing oilfields and develop new oil and gas fields once\nsanctions are lifted and is improving its oil investment\ncontract in order to lure them in.The major OPEC producer has started implementing a nuclear\ndeal with world powers, a step towards a broad settlement which\ncould lead to the end of sanctions.Western sanctions imposed over the nuclear programme have\nchoked Tehran's production - output is down a million barrels\nper day (bpd) since the start of 2012 to 2.7 million bpd -\ncosting billions in lost revenue.Top Iranian officials say the country can raise production\nto 4 million bpd within six months of sanctions being lifted.\nWestern experts are more conservative, saying 3 million to 3.5\nmillion bpd is more likely.Encouraged by the preliminary nuclear deal struck between\nIran and Western powers in November, Tehran and Big Oil have\nwasted no time making contact, in the hope of a full lifting of\nsanctions.Paolo Scaroni of Italy's Eni was the first Western CEO to\nmeet publicly with Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, on the\nsidelines of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries last month."], "2014/01/22/va-owens-minor-idUSnBw226537a+100+BSW20140122": [0, "2014/01/22", "Owens & Minor Plans to Release 4thQuarter & Full-Year 2013 Financial Results on Monday, February 10, 2014; \n      Management Conference Call Set for Tuesday, February 11, 2014 at 8:30 \n      a.m.Owens & Minor, Inc.

That's enough oil to\nsupply all needs in the United States, the world's biggest oil\nconsumer, for more than 14 months. \n    The BM-S-8 partners also expect to start drilling the\nGuanxuma prospect 30 kilometers from Carcar\u00c3\u00a1 in 2015.\n    In the same statement, QGEP also outlined its operations in\nother fields.\n    The Manati offshore field south-west of Salvador, Brazil,\nproduced an average of 6 million cubic meters of gas a day\n(211.9 mil cubic feet) in 2013, QGEP said.    \n     Manati is 45 percent owned by QGEP, 35 percent by\nPetrobras, which is also the operator, 10 percent by Brasoil and\n10 percent by Rio das Contas.\n    QGEP added it has submitted a development plan in December\nfor its 100 percent owned BM-J-2 block in the offshore\nJequitinhonha Basin off the coast of Brazil's Bahia state.

Revenue increased 38.5 percent to $29.2 billion in the quarter. \n      On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), \n      diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.21 for the \n      December quarter of fiscal 2014. In the tables that follow, we present \n      our GAAP results as well as a reconciliation of GAAP income from \n      continuing operations to adjusted non-GAAP income from continuing \n      operations.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our December quarter, we delivered solid results as we onboarded \n      substantial new business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Steven H.

Gross \n        profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 60 basis points to 2.48 \n        percent.Operating Expenses:In the first quarter \n        of fiscal 2014, operating expenses were $402.1 million, up 13.8 \n        percent over the same period in the last fiscal year. The increase in \n        operating expenses in the quarter was due primarily to costs \n        associated with onboarding the new Walgreen Co. business. Operating \n        expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fiscal 2014 first quarter \n        were 1.38 percent compared with 1.68 percent for the same period in \n        the previous fiscal year.Operating Income:In the fiscal 2014 \n        first quarter, operating income of $322.7 million was up 8.9 percent \n        versus the prior year, as the increase in gross profit was offset in \n        part by the increase in operating expenses. Operating income as a \n        percentage of revenue decreased 30 basis points to 1.11 percent in the \n        fiscal 2014 first quarter compared to the previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first \n        quarter.Tax Rate:The effective tax rate for the \n        first quarter of fiscal 2014 was 38.2 percent, up from 37.8 percent in \n        the previous fiscal year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter. Going forward, we expect our \n        annualized effective tax rate to be in the low 38 percent range.Earnings Per Share:Diluted earnings per \n        share from continuing operations were up 9.6 percent to $0.80 in the \n        first quarter of fiscal year 2014 compared to $0.73 in the previous \n        fiscal year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter, driven by the increase in operating \n        income.Shares Outstanding:Diluted weighted \n        average shares outstanding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 \n        were 235.4 million, a slight decrease versus the prior year as share \n        repurchases offset option exercises.Segment DiscussionThe Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes both AmerisourceBergen \n      Drug Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group. Other includes \n      AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier.Pharmaceutical Distribution SegmentIn the first fiscal quarter of 2014, Pharmaceutical Distribution \n      revenues were $28.6 billion, an increase of 39 percent compared to the \n      same quarter in the prior year. ABDC revenues increased 46 percent, due \n      primarily to the onboarding of the new Walgreens branded pharmaceuticals \n      business and increased sales to our large PBM customer, as well as other \n      large customers. ABSG revenues increased 8 percent, which was driven by \n      strong performance in our blood products, vaccine and physician office \n      distribution businesses. Intrasegment revenues between ABDC and ABSG \n      have been eliminated in the presentation of total Pharmaceutical \n      Distribution revenue. Total intrasegment revenues were $976.8 million \n      and $863.8 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, \n      respectively.Operating income of $286.8 million in the December quarter of fiscal \n      2014 increased 8 percent compared to the same period in the previous \n      year due to the new Walgreens branded pharmaceuticals business in ABDC, \n      strong contributions from generics, and solid performance in ABSG, as a \n      decline in performance in our community oncology business was offset by \n      strong performance in our physician office, vaccine and blood products \n      distribution businesses.OtherRevenues in Other were $604.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal \n      2014, an increase of 20 percent over the same period in the prior year. \n      Operating income increased 21 percent to $36.0 million in the first \n      quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by strong performance in World Courier.Fiscal Year 2014 ExpectationsAmerisourceBergen continues to expect adjusted diluted earnings per \n      share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2014 to be in the range \n      of $3.60 to $3.73, a 12 percent to 16 percent increase over fiscal 2013. \n      We have increased our revenue growth expectations to a range of 30 \n      percent to 34 percent, and continue to expect adjusted operating income \n      growth in the 12 percent to 16 percent range. We now expect adjusted \n      operating margin to decline in the 20 to 23 basis points range due to \n      the onboarding of significant new lower margin business and growth in \n      brand pharmaceutical business with our large customers. We continue to \n      expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $500 to $700 million, \n      with capital expenditures in the $300 million range; and to spend \n      approximately $500 million in share repurchases, subject to market \n      conditions.Conference CallThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the results at 11:00 \n      a.m. Eastern Time on January 23, 2014.Participating in the conference call will be:Steven H.

Now he is stress testing the euro zone's biggest banks.The European Central Bank's year-long review of the currency bloc's largest banks will be a game-changer for the euro zone, either drawing a line under its financial crisis or causing a new one if the scrutiny is deemed insufficient or the holes in banks' books place too great a burden on indebted states.This high-stakes exercise involves analyzing banks' balance sheets, picking apart their procedures for assessing risk, and exposing them to hypothetical crises that have become all too real in parts of Europe, such as property market collapses and soaring unemployment.It is a process that the ECB is keen to get right as it takes over the supervision of 130 euro zone banks later this year.For Wilkinson, co-head of risk and finance at the ECB's favored stress test consultant, Oliver Wyman, and an engineer by training, there are parallels with testing bridges.\"You look at historic stresses, how much traffic do you expect to go over it based on history ... what are the highest levels of wind you've ever experienced,\" he said. \"Then you look at how the bridge has been constructed. You're trying to get to the potential point of failure in the bridge.\"The problem for the investors, big depositors and taxpayers, who may have to make good any deficiencies in banks' balance sheets, is that the process of stress testing banks involves reams of data, differing definitions and a tight timetable.That might mean a bigger bill for them.\"The worse the data, the higher the capital charge,\" said Stephen Smith, who leads accountancy firm KPMG's Asset Quality Review taskforce.The Asset Quality Review is the ECB's review of euro zone banks' books, now under way ahead of this year's stress tests. The AQR assesses whether banks are currently adequately capitalized, while the stress test looks at whether they can withstand a future crisis.Interviews with more than 20 officials, bankers and consultants involved with previous stress tests in Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Greece - many of them speaking on condition of anonymity - suggest the ECB's health check will involve battles over basic definitions of loans, huge data requests and a painful process to verify the information.THE BLAME GAMEUnder pressure not to repeat the mistakes of previous stress tests in Europe and to uncover any nasty surprises on lenders' balance sheets before it takes over as the euro zone's financial supervisor in November, the ECB will be pressing banks for details about their loans, trades and risk models.During Spain's stress test of its banks in 2012, one banker recalls that his institution, a mid-sized lender, had to send more than 500,000 individual pieces of data.During tests in Greece, a local banker describes having to submit 180 fields of data for every personal loan being evaluated, and more than 100 for business loans. Hundreds of staff were involved.With a tight timetable, disputes are expected between the consultants seeking the information and the banks providing it.\"When these things start they request all this data, they don't get it, immediately a blame game takes place,\" said one consultant who has worked on bank reviews in the euro zone. \"They say we can't do the modeling because so and so hasn't provided the data.\"The ECB's efforts to get banks to use a common definition for non-performing loans and loans where forbearance is being shown will introduce fresh problems, consultants and banks say, since data isn't already collected in that way.Bankers say the stress testers couldn't possibly need all the data they are collating.A European regulator admits that some of the data fields inevitably don't matter, but says you have to comb through a lot of useless data to find the ones that do.\"You're trying to find the numbers that will tell you what's going to happen in the future,\" he said.When needs must, consultants can improvise. Several sources recall the drama when BlackRock employees found out that Ireland, whose banks they were testing in 2010, had no zip codes. In the end, that field had to remain unfilled.'NO RIGHT WAY'Consultants don't just take the data and set to work. They check its accuracy, including leaving their offices for on-site valuations.Over 10,000 properties were visited and valued during the Spain's 2012 stress tests.Some of the field trips have been enlightening. One consultant recalled sending someone to visit a cement factory who discovered it was in fact a pig farm.Establishing the banks' current position is, of course, just half the battle. What stress testers are best known for is working out how banks will fare when the stress hits, and how much capital they need to cope with that 'adverse scenario', a feat that involves a high level of judgment.Those judgments will have a major impact on the numbers the stress tests come out with.\"Is there a right way (to do a stress test)?\" the European regulator said. \"There isn't, really. There's a spectrum of approaches.\"KMPG's Smith said while there is little leeway around the baseline economic scenarios, which use forecasts from the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, there is discretion in forecasting elements such as future real estate prices and unemployment rates.Translating those economic scenarios and constraints into future losses at banks, and ultimately into banks' need to raise more cash, is another minefield.The Spanish banker said there were no issues with the loan loss models they encountered from Oliver Wyman, since their model is \"well recognized and respected\".The broad thrust is that loan losses don't increase gradually, but instead rise exponentially, since rising unemployment and house price falls affect lots of borrowers at the same time.What can be more divisive is predicting how much profit banks will make in the future, an important consideration since that profit cushions them against future losses and cuts the amount of capital they must raise.\"Here there was a bit of give and take - you have to try and convince them that the revenues will be as you say they will be,\" said the Spanish banker.With so much discretion at play, James Longsdon, co-head of EMEA banks research at ratings agency Fitch, said there is a debate about the role and implications of stress testing, and the more fact-based Asset Quality Review is likely to prove more useful in the end.\"The AQR is the most important by a country mile,\" said Longsdon. \"It genuinely is a re-assessment of solvency.\"(Additional reporting by Sarah White in Madrid.

We could see a top towards the end of this\nmonth followed by a maximum 10 percent correction in February,\"\nRoelof-Jan van den Akker, senior technical analyst at ING\nCommercial Banking, said.\"A pullback is what the market needs to build momentum for\nthe next rally back up again.\"Charts indicate that a correction could trigger around the\n3,170 mark - a 50 percent retracement of the 2007-2009 sell-off\n- and less than 1 percent away from current levels.Technically overbought conditions increase the chances of a\nfall. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for the Euro\nSTOXX 50 crossed above the 70 mark late last week into\noverbought territory, hitting its highest levels since May 2013\n- just before the index shed 11.5 percent in a month.\"We see Europe vulnerable for a short setback into mid-\nFebruary before resuming the underlying bull trend into summer,\"\nMichael Riesner, head of European technical analysis at UBS,\nsaid in a note.\"All in all, the underlying momentum in Europe is still\nhealthy and this suggests higher prices (in the) medium term,\"\nRiesner said.The Euro STOXX 50 has gained 55 percent since hitting a low\nin mid-2012 but the rally is showing signs of exhaustion. The\nindex is down this week after gaining in the past two weeks.\"The index is up against channel resistance from 2011 at\naround 3,176. There is bearish divergence present ... which is a\nsign of trend exhaustion,\" Murray Gunn, head of technical\nanalysis at HSBC, said.Charts suggest that most other European stock indexes might\ncome under selling pressure. Germany's DAX, which\nscaled new record highs this month after a 26 percent gain last\nyear, could see an acceleration in selling.Societe Generale technical analyst Loic de Galzain advised\ncaution in the near term given European markets' closeness to\nresistance levels.\"(A) consolidation of 5 to 8 percent could kick in if any\ntrouble arises,\" he said."], "2014/01/23/ny-disney-publishing-idUSnBw235776a+100+BSW20140123": ["Disney Publishing Worldwide Announces Exciting New Series, Waterfire Saga, and First Release, DEEP BLUE, from Award-Winning Novelist, Jennifer Donnelly", "2014/01/23", "Disney Publishing Worldwide Announces Exciting New Series, Waterfire \n      Saga, and First Release,DEEP BLUE,from Award-Winning Novelist, \n      Jennifer DonnellySeries to be cornerstone of new global franchiseDisney Publishing Worldwide (DPW) announced today the forthcoming \n      publication of the Waterfire Saga, an epic new series set in the depths \n      of the ocean where six mermaids seek to save their world, written by \n      award-winning,New York Timesbest-selling novelist Jennifer \n      Donnelly.

But as a record-breaking freeze coincides with pipeline outages and low inventories, the crisis is expected to linger.\"It's not a permanent shortage and we won't run out, but there are no avenues to deal with this shortage today other than a break in the weather,\" said Brandon Scholz, managing director of the Wisconsin Propane Gas Association.\"We could be sitting in this situation to spring.\"Most households are not connected directly to propane pipelines, and the system relies heavily on truck fleets now running at full capacity to get emergency supplies to states across the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast.The U.S. Department of Transportation has issued emergency orders suspending the limits on the amount of time truck drivers can spend on the road for 10 Midwestern states and 12 Northeastern states, a rare regional order.A spokesman for Pennsylvania-based AmeriGas, the largest U.S. propane retailer, said it was rationing deliveries to \"small pockets\" of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee on Thursday, reducing supplies to 100 gallons per customer from the standard delivery of some 250 gallons.\"Supply is very tight. There is propane to be had out there, but there are supply and transport issues across the country,\" spokesman Simon Bowman said.All the while, federal policymakers representing the Midwest have heard complaints from constituents angry about the high fuel prices.Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley called on the Federal Trade Commission to review the cause of a propane price spike in his state on Wednesday to \"ensure that any supply shortages are not created artificially.\"RATIONING, PRICE SPIKESU.S. propane production has grown in recent years thanks to the shale oil and gas boom, but the resulting higher supplies have caused domestic prices to sink below global levels. That in turn, has encouraged exports of the fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Japan and Latin America, where prices are higher.The shortage in the Midwest comes at a confluence of events: namely, record-breaking cold at the start of January, when stocks were already low after large amounts of propane were used to dry out a bumper corn harvest.A pipeline outage during most of December exacerbated the situation, and this week's freezing weather, expected to last to the end of the month, has heightened the situation.All the while prices have soared. Propane heading for the Midwest is priced against supplies in the hub in Conway, Kansas. Prices there touched almost $5 a gallon on Thursday, compared with Friday's pre-freeze price of around $1.75.Texas has lifted the need for out-of-state trucks to be registered with the state to allow other trucks to come and pick up supplies.\"Long lines have formed at Mont Belvieu,\" said one Houston-based broker, referring to the largest propane supply hub in the country. \"Lots of out-of-state trucks are showing up.\"LOW SUPPLIESIn northern Tennessee, the Stewart County School System opted to close on Thursday and Friday because of warnings from suppliers they were focused on deliveries to residences of up to 150 gallons, said Leta Joiner, assistant schools director.\"We're not sure how long this is going to last,\" Joiner said. \"We decided to err on the side of caution.\"One propane supplier in northern Indiana said customers pleaded for more fuel when he did his rounds on Thursday.

Nowadays even such small protests are rare at the Husseini mosque, once a weekly flashpoint of demonstrations inspired by revolts across the Arab world.A growing sense that regional upheaval has brought more pain than progress has combined with international aid, some political reform, state control and co-opting of opponents to sap opposition to the pro-Western monarch's 15-year-old rule.Protests in the kingdom, where a Hashemite monarchy styles itself as a unifying force for a diverse population, have involved Islamists among Jordanians of Palestinian origin and \"Herak\" activists from tribes that traditionally back the king.But they have not taken off like those which overthrew Egypt's Hosni Mubarak or shook President Bashar al-Assad's grip over neighboring Syria. Almost a million Syrian refugees have crossed into Jordan in nearly three years of civil war.\"Syria and Egypt and the whole question of what is happening in Arab Spring countries has thrown the Herak activists off balance,\" said Moeen al-Harasis, a leading Herak figure who has spent around four months in jail on and off over the past two years after calling for the overthrow of the monarchy.He is now standing trial in a military court, one of 40 Herak activists facing charges of undermining the state that carry a maximum penalty of 15 years hard labor.None are in detention and none have yet been sentenced, an example of how Jordan sends the message that persistent dissent will not be tolerated while avoiding the kind of crackdown which helped turn Syria's protests into an armed insurgency.\"The king's position has been secured by the deftness with which his security forces have contained Herak, and divided or isolated its different wings,\" said Tariq Tell, a Jordanian scholar and activist.DIVIDED HAVENThe king, born of a British mother and educated in Britain and the United States, has also benefited from a Western and Gulf commitment to shoring up a country whose role as a haven for successive flows of refugees underpins regional stability.Billions of extra aid dollars mitigating the impact of the Syrian refugee flood in a resource-poor country of just 7 million people also help to undermine Abdullah's critics beyond and within the tribal political and military establishment.Palestinians from the West Bank and further afield dominate private enterprise in Jordan and acquiesce politically in a system in which tribes from the East Bank of the river Jordan get state patronage in return for backing the king.The Herak tribal activists, led by a mix of disgruntled army officers and civilian officials, oppose IMF-backed austerity measures and fear the king might enact market-oriented reforms at their expense.Their fiercest protests occurred in provincial towns after steep increases in fuel costs in November 2011, echoing past civil unrest triggered by price rises for bread or fuel.Hundreds were arrested after demonstrations in which banks and state property were torched, but most were quickly released, after reforms legalized peaceful demonstrations without prior security approval.\"The king saw the Arab Spring knocking and said, 'You don't deny it, you deal with it, to create positive change rather than fight it off',\" a senior palace official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.In contrast to Herak, Islamist activists have strong roots among Jordanians of Palestinian origin in the big cities and have demanded fairer representation for urban communities - a platform which challenges the political prominence and financial subsidies enjoyed by the country's tribal power base.Security forces distributed soft drinks and water at some early protests and the 51-year-old monarch created funds for the poor, reversed subsidy cuts and raised salaries to assuage anger over costs of living.The parents of his wife, Rania, are of Palestinian origin and her background and high profile local and international role has drawn criticism from conservative tribal elements.But authorities won over some Herak leaders with jobs and perks and avoided a showdown with the Islamists, partly thanks to the toppling of their ideological allies in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, which reversed their growing assertiveness.STABILITY OR CHAOSThe deputy head of the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest opposition group, acknowledged that the crackdown on Egypt's Islamists and Syria's devastating civil war were both significant setbacks.\"The rivers of blood in Syria and the Egyptian model - also what is happening now in Iraq - created a feeling that was exploited by the regime to lower people's ambitions of reform,\" said Zaki Bani Rusheid. \"People were given a choice between the present reality of stability or chaos and destruction.\"Faced with those limited options, most ordinary Jordanians have decided to settle for stability.\"Jordanians see what's happening in Syria, Egypt, and Iraq and say: 'Yes we are under pressure but surely we are better than the others',\" said Abdul Hadi al-Majali, a prominent Jordanian politician.\"There is security and that is a very important factor.\"The king has taken the edge off the protests with constitutional changes to expand the role of parliament in appointing prime ministers. He says his aim is a British-style constitutional monarchy but has held back from major reform that might antagonize an entrenched tribal establishment.Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour's government has tapped into a $5 billion Gulf fund and resumed borrowing from international financial markets with U.S. loan guarantees - a far cry from the dire financial straits that pushed Jordan to the brink of economic collapse at the end of 2012.PRESSURE EASES, BUT PAIN AHEADAlong with the challenges, the refugee influx has brought economic benefits, economists and politicians say.In the northern border areas, Syrian refugees who fled violence just a few kilometers away are bringing much needed skills and rejuvenating once depressed nomadic border towns whose residents relied on state employment.Wealthier entrepreneurs have relocated businesses, filling up once idle space in the country's industrial parks while Jordan's employers have tapped a pool of cheap skilled labor, fuelling growth.On the political front, Western backers have eased pressure on Jordan for reform. \"The king is not feeling the domestic pressures and has convinced the international community he is doing the necessary reforms,\" said one senior Western diplomat.Opposition sources cite the arrests for public criticism of the monarch among signs of renewed intrusiveness by the intelligence apparatus that was reined in under the pressure of protests and the monarch's efforts to curtail its powers.Many politicians and independent observers say planned IMF austerity measures will inflict economic pain on many poor Jordanians, raising the risks of more protests and instability.Further IMF targeted electricity hikes are due this year to reduce billions of dollars of debts by state-owned companies that have resorted to importing expensive fuel oil to generate power after the rupture of cheap Egyptian gas supplies. Bread and water subsidies are also being cut.The kingdom has survived economic and political crises before, buoyed by foreign support and a sense the monarchy has brought some unity to a divided country surrounded by turbulence.\"Jordan will continue to feel that it has successfully ridden the wave of Arab transitions without seriously addressing some of the key economic and political challenges facing the country,\" said Marwan Muasher, a former minister who now works at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"And it will probably get away with it, at least for now.\"(Editing byDominic EvansandPhilippa Fletcher)"], "2014/01/24/nc-insteel-tenn-fire-idUSnPnCLmd6Bl+162+PRN20140124": [0, "2014/01/24", "MOUNT AIRY, N.C.,Jan. 24, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- Insteel Industries, Inc.

The views expressed are\nhis own)By John KempLONDONJan 24 (Reuters) - Accident investigators have told\nregulators in the United States and Canada that safety\nregulations have failed to keep pace with the risks of moving\nlarge volumes of crude oil by train.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and\nCanada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) wrote on Thursday to\nthe Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration\n(PHMSA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Transport\nCanada.The investigators made three new safety recommendations and\nreiterated one old one.The new recommendations would require crude-carrying trains\nto be routed away from densely populated areas, with their\ncargoes properly risk assessed and classified, and a oil spill\nresponse plan drafted for a worst-case scenario in which the\ntrain loses its entire load.But the accident investigators also reiterated their\nprevious concerns about the unsuitable design and poor\nperformance of Class 111 tank cars for carrying highly flammable\nliquids such as shale oil.The NTSB and TSB have been highlighting risks with the Class\n111 design for 20 years. In 2012, the NTSB recommended all Class\n111 tank cars used for carrying crude oil or ethanol be\nretrofitted with new safety features or phased out.The rail industry has taken steps to improve the design of\nnew tank cars, but remains divided over what to do with the old\nClass 111 tank cars currently in service. And regulators have\ndithered about introducing new rules.\"Although the PHMSA has initiated a rulemaking to address\nthe safety issue, it has not issued any new rules,\" the NTSB\nobserved.\"If unit trains of flammable liquids are going to be part of\nour nation's energy future, we need to make sure the hazardous\nmaterials classification is accurate, the route is well planned,\nand the tank cars are as robust as possible,\" NTSB Chairwoman\nDeborah Hersman said in a statement.Writing to the PHMSA and FRA, the NTSB emphasised it is\n\"vitally interested\"  in these recommendations and demanded a\nresponse within 90 days.Until now, the action from regulators has not been good\nenough. It is time for the White House and Congress to step in\nand insist on an accelerated timetable for phasing out old and\nunsuitable Class 111 tank cars before another serious accident\noccurs.KEY TRAIN ROUTE PLANSUnder existing regulations, rail operators must take special\ncare with trains carrying explosive, poisonous and radioactive\nsubstances.Special requirements include making a careful risk\nassessment of the route. Railroad operators must take into\naccount 27 separate risk factors, including track type,\ncurvature and the maintenance schedule as well as population\ndensity and emergency response capability along the route.Where possible, carriers must route high-risk trains away\nfrom urban areas. The primary concern is to prevent a\n\"catastrophic release or explosion in proximity to densely\npopulated areas, including urban areas and events or venues with\nlarge numbers of people in attendance, iconic buildings,\nlandmarks or environmentally sensitive areas,\" according to the\nNTSB.But the rules do not apply to flammable substances such as\ncrude and ethanol because rail regulators judged \"the risks are\nnot as great\".Following a spate of recent derailments and train fires,\nhowever, railroad operators have already taken some voluntary\nsteps to improve safety.The Association of American Railroads (AAR), which\nrepresents the major carriers, issued Circular OT-55-N in August\n2013.The circular extends the definition of a \"key train\" to\ninclude any train carrying 20 or more car loads of hazardous\nmaterial, including flammable liquids like crude.Key trains are subject to a speed limit of 50 miles per hour\n(80 kilometres per hour), have priority over all other trains on\nthe network, and are subject to stringent safety rules to\nminimise the risk of derailment.The NTSB now wants the PHMSA and FRA to expand the route\nplanning and selection requirements to any train identified as a\nkey train under OT-55-N, including those carrying flammable\nliquids. Where feasible, trains carrying large volumes of crude\nor ethanol would be re-routed to avoid populated areas.WORST-CASE SPILL PLANSIn a bizarre loophole, unit trains carrying dozens of tank\ncars full of crude oil are subject to fewer safety controls than\npipelines, road tankers, ships or barges.Other modes of transport must prepare detailed spill\nresponse plans, which are reviewed by regulators. But in the\ncase of rail \"current regulations do not require railroads\ntransporting crude oil in multiple tank cars to develop\ncomprehensive spill response plans and have resources on\nstand-by for response to worst-case discharges,\" according to\nthe NTSB.Current regulations, effective since 1996, only require a\ncomprehensive plan if a single tank car carries 42,000 gallons.\nClass 111 tank cars carry only about 30,000 gallons each. But\nthey are now being strung together in unit trains consisting of\ndozens of tank cars carrying as much as 1 million or even 2\nmillion gallons in total.Problems arise when a train carrying multiple tank cars\nderails and they all breach. According to the NTSB: \"spill\nplanning regulations do not take into account the potential for\na derailment of large numbers of 30,000 gallon tank cars, such\nas at Lac-Megantic (Quebec) where 60 tank cars together released\nabout 1.6 million gallons of crude.\"\"Although no one tank car meets the current threshold for\ncomprehensive spill planning, the Lac-Megantic accident and the\nwell-known poor lading retention performance history of Class\n111 tank cars have demonstrated the worst-case release potential\nof these unit trains, in many cases greater than 2 million\ngallons.\"The NTSB has therefore recommended PHMSA to revise its\nregulations to require comprehensive spill plans based on\nworst-case scenarios for all unit trains and trains carrying\nblocks of tank cars.UNSAFE TANK CAR DESIGNSThe NTSB and its Canadian counterpart both highlighted the\nneed for crude cargoes to be properly tested and classified as\nmedium or high-risk, something regulators in the United States\nand Canada have already implemented.But both accident investigation agencies reiterated their\nconcerns about the design and safety performance of Class 111\ntank cars and demanded they be retrofitted with enhanced safety\nfeatures or be phased out of service.Until now, there has been an unedifying battle about what to\ndo with the old tank cars. The NTSB and AAR have accepted they\npose a safety hazard and must be retrofitted or phased out\nquickly. But tank car owners and the oil industry want much\nlonger to upgrade them or take them out of service, as much as\n10 years.The two sides blame each other. Railroad operators point to\nthe poor safety performance of Class 111 tank cars involved in\naccidents. The oil industry, shippers and tank car owners insist\nthe design would be perfectly adequate if the train operators\ncould cut the number of derailments and actually keep tank cars\non the tracks.In this instance, it is the shippers and tank cars owners\nthat are wrong. Some derailments are inevitable even on the most\nwell-run railroad. So it is vital that when they occur, tank\ncars contain their contents safely.Unfortunately, Class 111 tank cars have a lousy performance.\nEven at comparatively slow speeds, more than half will rupture\nand release some or all of their contents in an accident. That\ndoes not matter so much when they are carrying innocuous\ncargoes. But it makes them unsuitable to carry dangerous loads\nlike crude.The Canadian accident investigators' report presents some\nfrightening numbers. The train that derailed in Quebec was\ncarrying 72 Class 111 tank cars. In total, 63 tank cars\nderailed. Of those, 60 tank cars (95 percent) released some or\nall of their contents.Reported damage included 33 tank cars with punctured shells,\n26 with punctured heads, 20 with damaged top fittings, 12 with\ndamaged pressure relief valves, 7 with impacted bottom fittings,\nas well as 4 with thermal tears and 2 with damage to manways.Better designs and retrofits could have prevented flammable\nliquids from being released from many of these tank cars.TIME FOR ACTIONClass 111 tank cars full of crude are quite literally an\naccident waiting to happen.Designating them in key trains, routing them away from urban\nareas and requiring comprehensive spill plans can reduce the\nrisks of a catastrophic accident. But it is imperative they are\nretrofitted or removed from service as quickly as possible.Removing all of them from service immediately would cause\nenormous disruption. But a decade is too slow to wait for\nimprovements given what we now know about the risks.Retrofits are expensive and there are capacity constraints\nat tank car manufacturers. However, the engineering is not that\ncomplicated. Three years ought to be more than enough for Class\n111 cars in crude and ethanol service to be upgraded, replaced\nor retired.If the industry and regulators cannot reach an agreement,\nthe White House, Congress and Canada's minister of transport\nshould step in to force the pace of change. \n\n (Editing byJason Neely)"], "2014/01/24/us-ukraine-germany-idUSBREA0N0NR20140124": ["Germany summons Ukraine ambassador over violence", "2014/01/24", "BERLIN(Reuters) - Germany has summoned Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin to demand an end to the government's use of force against protestors, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said on Friday.\"The aim of this summons is to make clear to Ukraine's official representative in Germany what the position of the German government is,\" said spokesman Martin Schaefer, adding that Berlin was seeking an end to recent violence and a re-examination of sweeping anti-protest legislation.\"We expect Ukraine's ambassador to pass on this message without delay to his government, the president and the prime minister.\"(Reporting byNoah Barkinand Michelle Martin)"], "2014/01/24/us-ptctherapeutics-ema-muscledrug-idUSBREA0N0VO20140124": ["EU panel recommends against PTC muscular disorder drug", "2014/01/24", "(Reuters) - PTC Therapeutics Inc said a committee of the European Medicines Agency recommended against a conditional approval to its drug for the treatment of a rare muscular disorder, sending its shares down nearly 30 percent in premarket trading.PTC joined a list of companies struggling with setbacks to their drugs to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder which causes muscle degeneration and eventual death in young boys.Prosensa Holding NV's partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc handed back the rights to its DMD drug less than two weeks ago after the failure of a key trial, forcing the smaller company to consider developing the drug on its own.Sarepta Therapeutics Inc lost almost two-thirds of its market value in November after the FDA said the design and goals of its trial might not be sufficient to get approval for its muscular disorder drug.PTC said it plans to request the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for a re-examination. It was seeking a conditional approval, granted to treatments that show early benefit.The drug, ataluren, is intended to treat a form of DMD which occurs due to a type of genetic mutation known as a nonsense mutation.Nonsense mutation leads to a premature end to the translation of a gene into a protein. About 15 percent of DMD cases are caused by nonsense mutations, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.Ataluren is designed to interact with a part of the cell known as a ribosome, enabling it to manufacture a protein called dystrophin, the absence of which causes muscle weakening in patients with DMD.The drug is being tested in a late-stage study for DMD, with results expected in mid-2015. PTC is also testing it as a treatment for cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations.PTC Therapeutics shares closed at $26.22 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.(Reporting by Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian)"], "2014/01/24/ny-fitch-ratings-idUSnBw245765a+100+BSW20140124": ["Fitch Rates Commonwealth Transportation Board's (VA) Trans Rev Refunding Revs 'AA+'; Outlook Stable", "2014/01/24", "Fitch Rates Commonwealth Transportation Board's (VA) Trans Rev Refunding \n      Revs 'AA+'; Outlook StableFitch Ratings has assigned a 'AA+' rating to the following Commonwealth \n      Transportation Board (CTB, or the board) bonds:--$56.13 million transportation revenue refunding bonds (Northern \n      Virginia Transportation District Program) series 2014A;--$147.29 million transportation revenue refunding bonds (U.S. 58 \n      Corridor Development Program) series 2014B.The bonds are expected to sell competitively on Feb. 5, 2014.In addition, Fitch has affirmed the 'AA+' rating on approximately $2.3 \n      billion CTB appropriation-backed transportation revenue bonds. A \n      detailed list of ratings follows at the end of this release.The Rating Outlook is Stable.SECURITYThe bonds are limited obligations of the CTB, secured by and payable \n      from general assembly appropriations or CTB allocations from general \n      assembly appropriations.KEY RATING DRIVERSCOMMONWEALTH APPROPRIATION OBLIGATION: The rating is based on ultimate \n      access to general assembly appropriations, not limited to transportation \n      revenues.TRANSPORTATION TRUST FUND OFFERS BROAD BACKSTOP: Despite the access to \n      commonwealth appropriations at large, the bonds are expected to be paid \n      from specific revenue streams, backstopped by access to the broad \n      transportation trust fund (TTF, or the fund), though the TTF\u00ef\u00bf\u00a2\u00ef\u00be\u20ac\u00ef\u00be\u2122s revenue \n      composition can be altered by the legislature.AAA COMMONWEALTH GO RATING: The commonwealth's GO bonds are rated 'AAA' \n      by Fitch, reflecting Virginia's conservative financial management, \n      diverse economy and moderate debt levels.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe rating for the bonds is sensitive to changes in the commonwealth's \n      'AAA' GO rating, to which it is linked.CREDIT PROFILEThe 'AA+' rating is based on ultimate access to legally available funds \n      in the Commonwealth of Virginia's TTF and other general assembly \n      appropriations. The Northern Virginia Transportation District (NVTD) \n      program bonds and the U.S. Route 58 (Route 58) bonds are expected to be \n      paid first from specific revenue streams within the larger \n      transportation trust fund (TTF) appropriations to CTB by the general \n      assembly.Importantly, the payment agreements for the NVTD and Route 58 bonds \n      specify that appropriations can be made by the general assembly from any \n      sources, including but not limited to TTF revenues.TTF REVENUES EXPECTED TO GROWThe TTF receives a variety of revenues representing various \n      highway-related taxes and a portion of the state sales and use tax. \n      Trust fund revenues totaled $1.084 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2013 and \n      are projected to total $1.204.5 billion in FY 2014, with the increase \n      attributable to a major transportation funding reform package enacted \n      during the 2013 legislative session. Overall, the CTB projects $3.5 \n      billion in new transportation funding over the next five years.Other commonwealth transportation bonds also have access to the TTF \n      including those issued for the commonwealth's Route 28 and Oak Grove \n      Connector projects, as well as federal highway revenue anticipation \n      notes (FRANs) and grant anticipation revenue notes (GARVEEs). Also, the \n      CTB's capital project revenue bonds which were initially authorized in \n      the amount of $3.18 billion have access to TTF funds if necessary.COMMONWEALTH FINANCES REMAIN SOUNDVirginia\u00ef\u00bf\u00a2\u00ef\u00be\u20ac\u00ef\u00be\u2122s 'AAA' rating reflects its substantial fiscal resources, \n      conservative approach to financial operations which includes periodic \n      revenue forecast updates, and low-to-moderate debt levels. Economic and \n      revenue performance has improved since the start of the 2010-2012 \n      biennium, which began July 1, 2010, and continued through fiscal 2013 \n      (the midway point of the 2012 - 2014 biennium). Revenue over-performance \n      through fiscal 2012, combined with below-budget spending, allowed the \n      commonwealth to close the 2010 - 2012 biennium on June 30, 2012 with a \n      surplus of $448.5 million.The commonwealth made a $133 million revenue stabilization fund (RSF) \n      deposit in fiscal 2013, and an additional $245 million deposit is \n      budgeted for fiscal 2014. Both deposits are required under \n      constitutional provisions to dedicate a portion of annual tax revenue \n      growth to the RSF. The legislature and governor also enacted a further \n      $95 million prepayment towards RSF deposits required in the next \n      biennium. Based on unaudited fiscal 2013 results, a $243 million deposit \n      will be due in fiscal 2015.Following these deposits, the RSF balance is expected to increase \n      substantially from its current level of $440 million to $689 million as \n      of June 30, 2014 (the end of the current biennium), and to $939 million \n      at the close of fiscal 2015.Additionally, Fitch notes that $30 million is programmed for deposit to \n      a Federal Action Contingency Fund (FACT), a second, statutory reserve \n      established to address the risk of federal deficit reduction, with a \n      further appropriation of $30 million contingent on attainment of a \n      budget surplus during the 2012-2014 biennium. Assuming $60 million is \n      ultimately set aside in the FACT fund, when combined with the expected \n      $689 million in the RSF, the commonwealth is projected to have \n      accumulated $749 million in reserves (representing approximately 4.4% of \n      forecasted fiscal 2014 revenues), by the close of the 2012 - 2014 \n      biennium.Fiscal 2014 revenues collections are trailing the official (reflecting \n      the enacted budget) and updated forecast estimates, though the state \n      notes that January data could substantially revise the current trend. \n      Through December, total general fund revenues were up 0.7% \n      year-over-year (YOY) versus the 1.5% official forecast and 1.7% in the \n      updated forecast. A decline in corporate income tax (CIT) collections is \n      the primary driver of the shortfall, with CIT down 17.2%, or just over \n      $60 million YOY. Virginia\u00ef\u00bf\u00a2\u00ef\u00be\u20ac\u00ef\u00be\u2122s CIT collections are generally very \n      volatile and the updated forecast projects collections will be only \n      slightly ahead of the prior year, increasing 0.4% by the end of fiscal \n      2014.Fitch anticipates federal sequestration, as well as the recent federal \n      shutdown, will negatively affect the commonwealth's general fund \n      revenues, primarily sales and income tax collections, given the \n      commonwealth's exposure to federal government and government-related \n      employment. While the full extent of any decline is unclear, Virginia \n      maintains sound and growing reserve levels to offset any near-term \n      effect on revenues.BROAD ECONOMIC BASEThe commonwealth benefits from a diverse economic base and high wealth \n      levels. Employment declined in 2009 and 2010 by 3.2% and 0.1%, \n      respectively, though this performance was less severe than national \n      declines of 4.4% and 0.7% for 2009 and 2010, respectively. Virginia \n      employment bottomed out in mid-2010, and 1.2% and 1.1% growth was \n      recorded in 2011 and 2012, respectively. As of November, YOY employment \n      growth was 0.7%, below the 1.7% growth rate for the nation. YOY \n      employment losses in federal government employment associated with \n      federal contraction began in April 2013 with a 0.2% decline, and \n      accelerated every month through October with a 2.7% decline. The pace \n      improved slightly in November to a 1.9% decline, but that could have \n      been skewed by the effects of the October federal shutdown. Fitch will \n      continue to monitor the effects of this contraction, although Fitch \n      believes the strength of the commonwealth's economy will allow it to \n      absorb anticipated losses without significantly weakening Virginia's \n      credit profile. Unemployment has historically been well below the \n      national rate, and the 5.4% rate for November 2013 represents just 77% \n      of the U.S. rate for the same month.Personal income growth in Virginia has been strong through most of the \n      last decade, typically exceeding that of the nation. After a 0.7% \n      decline in 2009 (less severe than the national decline of 2.9%), \n      personal income grew for the next three years. Growth in 2010 of 3.1% \n      and 6.1% in 2011 met or exceeded U.S. growth, while 3.7% growth in 2012 \n      slightly trailed national growth of 4.2%. Quarterly data through 3Q'13 \n      indicate personal income growth continues to lag the national trend. \n      Personal income per capita growth also lagged the national rate in 2012, \n      but remains high at $48,377 or 110.6% of the U.S. average in 2012; \n      Virginia ranks 10th among the states on this metric.WELL-MANAGED DEBT PROFILEThe commonwealth's debt ratios are in the moderate range and have grown \n      slightly over the past fiscal year. As of June 30, 2013, net \n      tax-supported debt totaled approximately $10.8 billion (preliminary, \n      unaudited basis), equal to 2.8% of 2012 personal income. GO debt \n      constitutes approximately 17% of net tax-supported debt, with the \n      remainder principally represented by various appropriation credits. \n      Certain appropriation-linked debt, are excluded from Fitch's calculation \n      of state debt due to their track record of self-support. Capital needs \n      for higher education and transportation improvements remain large with \n      substantial authorized but unissued balances outstanding.PENSION LIABILITIES UNDER CONTROLOn a combined basis, the burden of the commonwealth's net tax-supported \n      debt and unfunded pension obligations equals 4.6% of 2012 personal \n      income, below the median of 7% for U.S. states rated by Fitch. The \n      adjusted calculation includes the commonwealth's portion of the total \n      liability of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) covering only \n      commonwealth employees, and the full liability for several much smaller \n      systems where the commonwealth is the sole employer. The system-wide \n      funding of the VRS declined in recent years in part due to underfunding \n      of contributions (partially used as a budget balancing measure), and the \n      June 30, 2012 funded ratio on a reported basis was 65.8%, down from 84% \n      funded on June 30, 2009. As of 2011, the system utilizes a 7% investment \n      return assumption, in line with Fitch's standard adjustments to pension \n      system liability calculations for other governments. In recent years, \n      the commonwealth enacted pension reforms addressing required \n      contribution levels and various plan design changes, all expected to \n      limit further growth in the commonwealth's pension liabilities in the \n      coming years. Importantly, the commonwealth anticipates phasing back in \n      full actuarially required contributions by fiscal 2019. Funded ratios \n      could weaken until then, though Fitch does not anticipate material \n      reductions, absent significant investment market declines.As indicated above, Fitch has affirmed the 'AA+' rating for the \n      following CTB appropriation-backed transportation revenue bonds that are \n      supported by commonwealth appropriations and therefore linked to the \n      commonwealth's GO rating. The Outlook on all of the ratings remains \n      Stable.--$255.16 million in NVTD transportation revenue and revenue refunding \n      bonds;--$347.98 million in U.S. Route 58 corridor development program revenue \n      and revenue refunding bonds;--$15.825 million in Oak Grove Connector, city of Chesapeake \n      transportation revenue and revenue refunding bonds;--$1.62 billion in transportation capital projects revenue bonds.In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's \n      Tax-Supported Rating Criteria, this action was additionally informed by \n      information from the Underwriter and IHS Global Insight.Applicable Criteria and Related Research:--'Fitch Rates VA Public School Auth's School Financing Bonds (1997 \n      Resolution) Ser 2013 B 'AA+'' (Oct. 21, 2013);--'U.S. State Government Tax-Supported Rating Criteria' (Aug. 14, 2012).Applicable Criteria and Related Research:U.S. State Government Tax-Supported Rating Criteriahttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=686033Additional DisclosureSolicitation Statushttp://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=816991ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND \n      DISCLAIMERS.

At least nine others were killed when bands of people, some of them Christian groups, attacked and looted shops, witnesses said.The violence has killed more than 2,000 since December, and forced about a million people - nearly a quarter of the population - to flee their homes.(Reporting by Paul-Marin Ngoupana andEmmanuel Braun; Writing byEmma Farge; Editing byAndrew Roche)"], "2014/01/25/idUSnHUGdtPT+73+ONE20140125": [0, "2014/01/25", "Marine Harvest is pleased to announce that it will list and commence trading of its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) represented by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) through Citibank, N.A.

I hit some good ones coming down the stretch but hit a really bad drive at 17 and managed to make a really good par.\"Stallings, who won his maiden PGA Tour title in a playoff for the 2011 Greenbrier Classic before adding a second at the 2012 True South Classic, sank par putts from 14 feet at the 15th and six feet at the 17th to remain on course for victory.He set up his birdie at the 18th with a four-iron from 225 yards but watched as his ball landed on the front portion of the green before rolling back to the fringe, with a pond lurking below.\"I hit that four-iron as hard as I possibly could, and just tried to get it over the front (of the green). It barely stayed,\" Stallings said.American Gary Woodland and Australian Marc Leishman, playing in the final group, had the chance to force a playoff over the last two holes but Woodland's title bid ended with a double-bogey on 17 and Leishman's when he failed to eagle 18.Leishman's wedge from 100 yards ended up four feet from the cup and he settled for a birdie and a 71 to tie for second with compatriot Jason Day (68), South Korean K.J. Choi (66), Canada's Graham DeLaet (68) and American Pat Perez (70).The long-hitting Woodland, who like Stallings had been seeking a third victory on the PGA Tour, covered his back nine in two-over to close with a 74 and finish joint 10th at six under.BIRDIE SLUGFESTDamp overnight and early morning conditions made the tough South Course a little more receptive to low scoring and Sunday's final round ended up as a birdie slugfest with 10 players holding at least a share of the lead.By the time overnight pacesetter Woodland had reached the turn in the final group, 17 players were bunched within two shots at the top of a wildly fluctuating leaderboard.A stroke in front after the third round, Woodland offset bogeys at the first and seventh with birdies at the second and ninth for an outward nine of even par to remain at eight under overall.That left him in a four-way tie for the lead with Perez, Leishman and early starter Choi, who moments earlier had birdied the final hole for a 66.Woodland did well to save par at the 10th and 11th, sinking tricky putts from 12 and nine feet, and also at the 12th, where he got up and down from a poor lie under overhanging branches beneath the right side of the green, to remain at eight under.Stallings seized the outright lead at nine under by sinking a 10-foot birdie putt at the 14th before being joined by Woodland, who knocked in a six-footer for birdie at the par-five 13th.Both Woodland, at 14, and Stallings, at 16, slipped back with bogeys and six players shared the lead before Stallings got back to nine under with his birdie at the last, then watched to see if he would be caught.Woodland's title bid evaporated when he pulled his tee shot into a hazard at the 17th on the way to a double-bogey six and Stalling's victory was assured when Leishman failed to eagle the final hole.The tournament's top draw cards were both absent from Sunday's final round, Phil Mickelson having withdrawn on Friday with muscle pain in his back and seven-times winner Tiger Woods failing to make the third-round cut after a 79 on Saturday.Between them, the two Californians have won the Farmers Insurance Open on 10 occasions and always attract huge galleries at the picturesque coastal venue.(Reporting byMark Lamport-Stokesin Los Angeles; Editing byGene Cherry)"], "2014/01/27/lgelectronics-earnings-idUSS6N0F802R20140127": ["LG Electronics Q4 profit doubles on strong TV sales", "2014/01/27", "SEOULJan 27 (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc \nbeat analyst estimates by doubling its fourth-quarter profit, as\nheavy promotional activity in the U.S.'s Black Friday shopping\nseason lifted TV sales, offsetting a small loss at its mobile\narm.Operating profit totalled 238 billion won ($220 million) in\nOctober-December, the world's second-biggest TV maker after\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd said in a statement on\nMonday.That compared with the 223 billion won estimate of 35\nanalysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as well as the 117\nbillion won of a year earlier and 218 billion won of\nJuly-September.The South Korean manufacturer said operating profit at its\nTV business reached 174 billion won from just 80 million won a\nyear prior.Its mobile business, ranked No.3 by shipments after Samsung\nand Apple Inc, swung to an operating loss of 43 billion\nwon from profit of 56 billion won a year earlier, as the company\nspent more on marketing flagship products such as its G2 and G\nPro smartphones.\n($1 = 1080.3500 Korean won)\n\n (Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"], "2014/01/26/bkn-wizards-jazz-writethru-idUSMTZEA1QZRJF7E20140126": ["Jazz hang on against Wizards", "2014/01/26", "Jazz hang on against WizardsSALT LAKE CITY -- Earlier this week, the Utah Jazz were happy to get the Minnesota Timberwolves off their schedule for a while.After Saturday night, they were glad to see the Washington Wizards leave town, too.Especially after a wild final minute.Center Enes Kanter scored 24 points off the bench and the Jazz rallied before holding on to beat the Wizards 104-101 at EnergySolutions Arena.Jazz shooting guard Gordon Hayward scored 16 points, including two free throws with 3.6 seconds remaining, to help Utah improve to 15-29.

I feel like we had this game won. We just didn't do a good job in stopping them and they just kept making good plays.\"Favors played after missing Tuesday's home loss to Minnesota with a strained right hip abductor. He finished with a game-high 14 rebounds and 11 points.\"I was a little rusty out there,\" Favors said. \"I was able to shake the rust off, but overall I felt good out there.\"Utah took an 85-77 lead with 9:21 remaining after opening the fourth quarter with eight straight points.All five starters scored in double figures for the Wizards, including a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double from center Marcin Gortat.

Such claims have been the subject of widespread litigation nationwide.Federal labor law excludes \"changing clothes\" from the time for which unionized employees must be paid, unless they have negotiated otherwise. The Supreme Court clarified on Monday that safety gear generally fits within that definition, resolving a question that had split lower courts.\"A good bit of the uncertainty was cleared away,\" said Lawrence DiNardo, an attorney for U.S. Steel.The workers' lawyer, Eric Schnapper, could not immediately be reached for comment.\"DONNING AND DOFFING\"Roughly 800 current and former workers at U.S. Steel's Gary, Indiana, plant said flame-retardant jackets and pants, work gloves, wristlets, hard hats and other items they have to wear are \"personal protective equipment,\" not clothing.U.S. Steel disagreed, saying any wearable item is clothing. As a result, it said it should not have to pay unionized employees for \"donning and doffing.\"Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the time spent putting on safety gear was not subject to compensation because it was not sufficiently different from \"changing clothes.\"He mentioned such items as pants, hardhats and leggings as \"commonly regarded as articles of dress.\"Scalia conceded that safety glasses, ear plugs and respirators, which the workers also wear, are not generally viewed as clothes, but he said a ruling separating different types of items would create a problem for judges handling such cases.It is unlikely that Congress intended to \"convert federal judges into time-study professionals,\" Scalia wrote. He referred to a lower court ruling that said the time spent putting on safety glasses and earplugs was \"minimal\" and that respirators are put on as needed at work stations.Various industry groups, mainly in the food industry, had backed U.S. Steel.If backdated claims had been allowed, it would have been \"devastating to many employers,\" the Grocery Manufacturers Association said in a friend-of-the court brief.The case is Sandifer v.

Even with its excess cash position,Hudson Valley'snet interest margin was 2.95 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 2.99 percent in the linked quarter and 3.28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.The Company maintained its historically low average cost of deposits at 0.18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, unchanged from the linked quarter and 3 basis points below the fourth quarter of 2012.The year endingDecember 31, 2013saw continued growth ofHudson Valley'slow-cost core deposit base, which represented 97 percent of total deposits at year end.\u00c2\u00a0 Core deposits, which exclude time deposits greater than$100,000, totaled$2.5 billionatDecember 31, 2013, representing an increase of$126.3 millionover the core deposit balance atDecember 31, 2012.Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest ExpenseTotal non-interest income was$2.6 millionin the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to$4.2 millionin the linked quarter and$4.3 millionin the fourth quarter of 2012.Hudson Valley'sservice charge revenue was$1.2 millionin the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to$1.4 millionin both the linked quarter and the fourth quarter of 2012. The fourth quarter of 2013 included the$1.2 millionother-than-temporary impairment charge related to management's intent to sell the trust preferred collateralized debt obligations.Hudson Valley'sinvestment management fees remained relatively stable at about$1.9 millionin the fourth quarter of 2013, unchanged from the linked quarter and a decrease from$2.2 millionin the fourth quarter of 2012.Non-interest expense for 2013 included approximately$1.3 millionof non-recurring fees and expenses incurred to fully address matters raised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the previously disclosed Formal Written Agreement, which was lifted in October. Excluding the$18.7 millionpre-tax impact of the goodwill impairment and the$1.3 millionwrite-off associated with the branch consolidations, and the above mentioned non-recurring fees, non-interest expense declined by$3.7 millionor 4.5 percent in 2013, close to meeting the Company's target 5.0 percent reduction in non-interest expense year over year.The Bank's efficiency ratio, which has reflected the impact of excess liquidity on net interest income, excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment, was 82.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 84.2 percent in the third quarter of 2013 and 75.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.Portfolio Credit QualityThe Company demonstrated continued progress toward diversifying its lending base. During 2013 loans secured by 1-4 family residential mortgages balances grew by$36.5 million, or 9.2 percent, over the linked quarter and by$107.2 million, or 32.9 percent, over the fourth quarter of 2012. Loans secured by 1-4 family residential mortgages totaled$433.0 millionatDecember 31, 2013, compared to$325.8 millionat the end of the fourth quarter of 2012.CRE represented 307 percent of risk-based capital atDecember 31, 2013, and continues to be within the Company's previously disclosed commitment to maintain CRE concentration levels below 400 percent.Overall portfolio trends continue to reflect a gradually improving credit environment acrossHudson Valley'sniche commercial franchise in metropolitanNew York.Hudson Valley'stotal nonperforming assets (NPAs), including nonaccrual loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, accruing loans delinquent over 90 days and other real estate owned (OREO), were$23.5 millionatDecember 31, 2013, compared to$34.0 millionatSeptember 30, 2013and$35.1 millionatDecember 31, 2012. NPAs totaled 0.78 percent of total assets atDecember 31, 2013, compared to 1.12 percent atSeptember 30, 2013and 1.21 percent atDecember 31, 2012.Reflecting generally improving credit trends, net charge-offs declined to$0.5 millionfor the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to$0.8 millionand$3.0 millionin the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. As a percentage of average loans, annualized net charge-offs were 0.13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 0.23 percent in the third quarter of 2013 and 0.82 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.The Bank's provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 was$0.6 million, compared to$0.8 millionin the linked quarter and$1.5 millionin the fourth quarter of 2012.The Bank's allowance for loan losses was$26.0 millionatDecember 31, 2013, compared to$25.9 millionatSeptember 30, 2013and$26.6 millionatDecember 31, 2012. The allowance measured 1.59 percent, 1.64 percent and 1.81 percent of total loans at each of those dates, respectively.AtDecember 31, 2013, classified assets represented 20.7 percent of Tier 1 capital plus the allowance, compared to 29.1 atSeptember 30, 2013and 35.6 percent atDecember 31, 2012.The goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by the recent loss of clients and a reduction in the projected earnings capacity of the Company's asset management subsidiary.\u00c2\u00a0 The goodwill impairment represents a noncash accounting adjustment which will not affect cash flows, liquidity or tangible capital. Since goodwill is excluded from regulatory capital, the impairment charge will not have an adverse impact on the capital ratios of the Company and its Banking subsidiaryHudson Valley Bank, both of which will continue to have regulatory capital in excess of levels to be considered well capitalized. The Company's asset management subsidiary's earnings for the year 2013, before the impairment charge was$0.9 million, or$0.05per diluted share. The Company does not consider these earnings to be material to the Company's financial results.The other than temporary impairment charge on the Company's trust preferred securities portfolio resulted from management's decision to sell the trust preferred securities portfolio in late December given the uncertainty of the pending final regulations of the Volker rule. The Company sold its entire portfolio of trust preferred securities, inJanuary 2014, for approximately$8.7 million, prior to the federal Banking agencies' interim final rule. \u00c2\u00a0The securities had been carried at an estimated fair value of$3.3 million.\u00c2Quarterly Cash Dividend and Capital ManagementHudson Valley'sboard of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of$0.06per share, payable onFebruary 14, 2014to all common stock shareholders of record as of the close of business onFebruary 7, 2014.AtDecember 31, 2013, Hudson Valley Holding Corp. posted a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 16.2 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.5 percent. ItsHudson Valley Banksubsidiary atDecember 31, 2013posted a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.1 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.8 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.3 percent.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2Subsequent EventIn earlyJanuary 2014, the Company prepaid all of its outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. The borrowings totaled$16.4 millionand the related prepayment penalty totaled$1.9 million.\u00c2\u00a0 The effect of the prepayment will be reflected in the Company's first quarter 2014 financial results.Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures and Reconciliation to GAAPIn addition to evaluating Hudson Valley Holding Corp's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share.\u00c2\u00a0 Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Hudson Valley Holding Corp's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other Banks.\u00c2\u00a0 Further, the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used by management to analyze the relative strength of Hudson Valley Holding Corp's capital position.In addition, Hudson Valley Holding Corp. in this press release discloses net income exclusive of the charge related to goodwill impairment and other-than-temporary impairment charge.\u00c2\u00a0 The Company believes that this presentation of net income is important to investors because it provides a more appropriate comparison to the prior quarter and prior year results.In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by Hudson Valley Holding Corp. for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.Conference CallAs previously announced,Hudson Valleywill hold its quarterly conference call to review the Company's financial results onTuesday, January 28, 2014at10:00 AM ET:Domestic (toll free):1-888-317-6016; International (toll): + 1-412-317-6016.All participants should dial in at least ten minutes prior to the call and request the \"HVB Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.\"A replay of the call will be available one hour from the close of the conference throughFebruary 10, 2014at9:00 AM ET:Domestic Toll Free:1-877-344-7529 - Conference ## 10039312; International Toll: +1-412-317-0088 - Conference # 10039312.Participants will be required to state their name and Company upon entering call.The Company webcast will be available live at10:00 AM ET, and archived after the call through its website atwww.hudsonvalleyBank.com.About Hudson Valley Holding Corp.Through itsHudson Valley Banksubsidiary, Hudson Valley Holding Corp.

However, traders said volumes were low and\nanalysts cautioned yields could rise again if the emerging\nmarket rout deepens.Tighter credit conditions in China and expectations the\nFederal Reserve will further scale back its monetary stimulus\nhave fuelled large outflows from developing markets, with\ncurrencies in Turkey, Argentina and Russia hitting record lows.The sell-off hit junk-rated Greek and Portuguese bonds more\nthan other euro zone debt. By contrast, Spanish shares were\namong the worst hit due to their exposure to Latin America.Two-thirds of Spanish bonds are held by domestic investors,\nwho are less likely to sell when global sentiment towards risky\nassets sours. By comparison, only about half of Portuguese bonds\nare owned by locals, making the country more vulnerable to such\nshifts.At a sale of 10-year bonds last year, only 14 percent  were\nsold to Portuguese investors, debt agency data shows. UK and\nU.S. buyers took larger chunks.At Spain's 10-year bond sale last week, 39 percent went to\ndomestic investors, according to a primary dealer.Data on Greece was not immediately available, but traders\nsay many of the bonds are in the hands of foreign hedge funds,\nmany of them based in the United States.Bailed-out Greece and Portugal have also lured investors\nwith mandates to invest in emerging markets as their yields are\nclose to those in similarly-rated developing economies. The duo\nhave dropped out of the main euro zone bond indexes due to their\nratings so count on a significantly different investor base than\ndo other euro zone states.\"It comes down to who owns it,\" said Hans Humes, chief\ninvestment officer at Greylock Capital, referring to Greek debt,\nwhich the firm owns. \"The big holders are people who own\nemerging markets.

Back in 2007 BMO bought London-based\nPyrford International for an undisclosed sum, while Royal Bank\nof Canada swooped on BlueBay Asset Management in 2010.The acquisition would also be BMO's largest since it\npurchased U.S. lender Marshall & Ilsley for $4.1 billion in\n2011, part of the bank's push to build its presence in the U.S.\nMidwest.Ian Nakamoto, director of research at Montreal-based wealth\nmanager MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, said he was surprised\nBMO was making such a big purchase outside of its core Canadian\nand U.S. markets, but applauded the move to bulk up its wealth\nmanagement reach.\"I like that area and I think most people like that area,\nnot only because it's less capital-intensive, but because it's\nfee-based and it seems to be growing,\" he said.Paul Deegan, BMO's head of government and public relations,\nsaid the bank had no further comment on the FC talks.The bank's Toronto-listed shares were down 2.1 percent at\nC$70.49 on Monday afternoon, trading roughly in line with the\nbank's Canadian peers.OUTFLOWSShore Capital analyst Owen Jones said the offer, at about 13\ntimes F&C's full-year earnings, or 0.9 percent of its assets\nunder management, was \"fair\" and in line with the sector.While rival managers like Aberdeen Asset Management \nand Jupiter Fund Management tend to trade at higher\nearnings multiples, more than half of F&C's assets are run on\nbehalf of legacy pension fund clients and attract lower fees.Analysts at Numis said the price did not look like a\n\"significant premium\", however.\"We would therefore see 122p as very much a floor value\n(given the board's recommendation), with some upside potential\nif other interested parties were to emerge, given the price,\"\nthey said in a note to clients.F&C has struggled in recent years with client outflows and\nrelatively weak earnings compared with some rivals, who have\nexpanded more aggressively into higher-margin products.That underperformance prompted activist investor Edward\nBramson to take control of the group in a 2011 boardroom coup.\nBramson stepped down as chairman in August, believing his\nturnaround strategy was fulfilled.BMO has until Feb. 24 to announce whether it intends to make\na formal offer for F&C. \n ($1=0.6060 British pound)\n ($1 = 1.1060 Canadian dollars)\n\n (Additional reporting byEuan Rochaand Cameron French in\nToronto; editing by Erica Billingham, Greg Mahlich, Jeffrey\nHodgson andMatthew Lewis)"], "2014/01/27/energizer-holdings-idUSnPnCGmMHBb+16e+PRN20140127": [0, "2014/01/27", "ST.

Additionally, it increases the capability to remotely fix technical problems, thereby reducing costs, while accelerating the time-to-market.Furthermore, NEC will highlight its Traffic Management Systems (TMS) and NetCracker's Telecom Operation and Management Systems (TOMS) that provide centralized control over carriers' end-to-end networks and optimize traffic flow. This enables telecom carriers to differentiate themselves on a Quality of Service (QoS) basis, service providers to gain bandwidth assurance, and consumers to benefit from increased security and a more consistent quality.NEC solutions at Mobile World Congress 2014 include: Carrier Data Center Infrastructure, Virtual Data Center (vDC) Solutions, Enterprise-RAN (E-RAN) Solutions, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Big Data Analysis Solutions and Image Recognition ServicesMr.Takayuki Morita, executive vice president at NEC, commented, \"Mobile World Congress provides an ideal opportunity for NEC to showcase its ability to help telecom operators cost-effectively anticipate and meet the coverage and capacity demands of consumers in a mobile data era. By using our innovative SDN, NFV and related carrier solutions, operators can gain unprecedented control over the scale, scope and speed of their networks.\"NEC welcomes visitors at Mobile World Congress at the Fira Gran Via,Barcelona,February 24-27, 2014in Hall 3, Stand 3N10.Contact:NEC CorporationJoseph Jasper\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2Tel: +81-3-3798-6511\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2e-mail:j-jasper@ax.jp.nec.com\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2NECEuropeHelen Mcinnes\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2Tel: +44-20-8836-2167\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2e-mail:helen.mcinnes@emea.nec.comSOURCE  NEC Corporation"], "2014/01/27/montepaschi-bankofitaly-idUSR1N0JO01Z20140127": ["Bank of Italy met Monte Paschi heads to discuss rapid capital hike", "2014/01/27", "MILANJan 27 (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy said on Monday\nit had met with the top management of Banca Monte dei Paschi di\nSiena and its main foundation shareholder to discuss\nprospects for a rapid capital increase at the bank.\"The meeting took place in a constructive climate,\" the Bank\nof Italy said in a statement.Loss-making Monte dei Paschi, which received 4.1 billion\neuros of state aid last year after being hit by the sovereign\ndebt crisis and a derivatives scandal, is looking to raise 3\nbillion euros in fresh capital.The foundation forced the bank last year to delay the cash\ncall until mid-2014 to gain more time to sell down its stake in\nthe bank to pay back debts.\n\n (Reporting byStephen Jewkes)"]}

Los Angeles (30-19-6) was shut out for the fifth time this season.\"There's a team-wide frustration and a personal frustration for some guys in here,\" Kings forward Dustin Brown said. \"I don't know how many really good chances we had, and that's probably a bit of them playing really well and us not being hungry enough to get in the dirty areas.\"Ekman-Larsson's goal for a 2-0 lead came just seconds after Kings center Jordan Nolan was given consecutive two-minute minors for interference and roughing after his high check flattened forward Kyle Chipchura.Coyotes left winger Paul Bissonnette also received roughing and 10-minute misconduct penalties when he punched Nolan after the check, the second confrontation between the two this season.\"I thought it was a bad call,\" Kings coach Darryl Sutter said. \"We shouldn't have gotten that extra penalty.\"Nolan leveled Coyotes defenseman Rostislav Klesa with a check in a preseason game Sept. 15, and Bissonnette left the bench to fight Nolan. Klesa was carried off the ice on a stretcher and experienced concussion and whiplash symptoms the next day, the team said. Nolan was not penalized, but Bissonnette was suspended 10 games for leaving the bench.

second, state\ninvolvement may be inevitable as there are not many big local\nplayers, third, foreign banks will resist, and fourth, it could\nend up hurting the very taxpayers Orban is trying to protect.Hungary has become deeply unprofitable for most foreign\nlenders, partly thanks to taxes aimed at the banks and a\ngovernment-imposed relief scheme for borrowers struggling to\nrepay Swiss franc loans sold to them by banks in better times.\"The government's strategy is to bring the net present value\nof foreign bank operations to zero, so it can then be\ntransferred into local hands,\" said Peter Attard Montalto at\nNomura.Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy, a close ally of\nOrban, said recently that four major banks could quit Hungary in\nthe next 6-18 months and the economy minister has said one or\ntwo foreign banks might be considering leaving.But Raiffeisen's refusal of the offer by Szechenyi Bank and\nthe size difference between the two shows the government's\ndeclared aim of having at least half the sector in local hands,\nfrom around 40 percent by assets now, may not be plain sailing.Even with heavy losses, most foreign banks have ruled out\nselling, and there are few local lenders big enough to take them\non. Banks based in Hungary account for about 9 trillion forints\nin assets of the 23.4 trillion held by the 10 largest lenders\nbased on 2012 figures.\"It is difficult to see who would step in after what may be\nan uncooperative squeeze out and who could have the capacity,\"\nsaid Piroska M. Nagy, an economist at the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development.\"Some diversification of ownership and funding would be\ndesirable, but in a business-friendly and co-ordinated way.\"STATE HOLDS BACK, FOR NOWRaiffeisen decided against selling its Hungarian operation\nfor now after it was offered what sources with knowledge of the\nsituation called a \"knock-down price\".Szechenyi's majority owner Istvan Torocskei, a businessman\nappointed in 2011 to head the government debt agency, declined\nto comment on the Raiffeisen talks when approached by Reuters in\nBudapest on the sidelines of a news conference.He has told Austrian media \"hasty leaks\" were part of the\nreason why the deal fell through and replied, \"God knows\", when\nasked if something could still happen. Officials at Szechenyi\nBank did not respond to Reuters requests for an interview.There is no evidence that the government was directly\ninvolved in Szechenyi's failed efforts to take over the\nRaiffeisen unit but Budapest does have strong links to the bank,\nincluding a 49 percent ownership stake.Last week, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said in response to\na lawmaker that the government did not plan to buy Raiffeisen's\nlocal unit \"in the near future.\" His ministry declined to\ncomment directly on the failed takeover.It said in an email it still wanted at least 50 percent of\nthe banking sector in local hands, adding that it did not aim to\nreach this goal based on state ownership. It said the government\nshould be mindful of taxpayers' money when investing in any\nbank.Relative to Raiffeisen's business in Hungary, Szechenyi Bank\nis so small it is \"invisible to the naked eye,\" said Peter\nFelcsuti, Raiffeisen's chief executive in Hungary for 21 years\nuntil 2011. For it to take over the Raiffeisen's unit would, he\nsaid, not be good for the banking sector.Raiffeisen's Hungarian unit had assets of $8.3 billion at\nthe end of June and 123 branches. Szechenyi Bank had $88 million\neuros in assets at the end of 2012.BANKER BASHINGPrior to the 2008 financial crisis, Hungarians scrambled for\nloans to buy homes and cars, generating big profits for foreign\nbanks including Austria's Erste Bank, Italy's\nUnicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo and Belgium's\nKBC.In 2007, the bank sector earned 226.5 billion forints based\non official statistics compared with a pre-tax loss of 149\nbillion forints in 2011 and 105.5 billion in 2012.A subsequent slide in the local forint currency as the\nglobal financial crisis hit, has left hundreds of thousands of\nHungarians swamped in debt and the local economy hurting.The issue has meant that banker bashing has become a popular\npolitical pastime.Orban has accused the foreign banks of unscrupulous lending\npractices and he has been a thorn in their side since winning a\nlandslide victory in 2010. With elections in April that appear\nset to extend his time in power that pressure is unlikely to\nease.Orban imposed Europe's highest bank levy on Hungary's banks\nin 2010 and could yet impose a new relief scheme for borrowers.But his master plan is to shrink the foreign lenders'\npresence. He has said a locally-run banking sector would ensure\na better supply of credit to the local economy and reduce its\nexposure to sudden capital withdrawals by foreign banks.But it would also leave taxpayers on the hook for bank\ndebts, something neighbouring Slovenia is now struggling with\nafter its state-owned banks got into trouble, leaving it with a\n4.8 billion euros bailout bill.The chief executive of Hungary's largest lender OTP Bank\n, said last month it was interested in any bank that\nmight come up for sale. However, Sandor Csanyi also said the\nbank, the largest independent lender in central Europe, would\nnot strain its balance sheet to do deals.Raiffeisen Hungary Chief Executive Heinz Wiedner said last\nweek that major banks were unlikely to leave Hungary in the near\nterm but this prospect could not be ruled out in the long run.Erste, Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit and KBC have all said they\nwould stay. Budapest Bank, a unit of G.E. Capital, has\nalso told Reuters it would not leave.That would leave as possible targets only Raiffeisen -- and\nMKB, a unit of Germany's Bayern LB, which must be\nsold under a state aid deal agreed with the European Union.Raiffeisen's Wiedner said staying was the \"right decision\"\nbut a high bank tax and a general anti-bank atmosphere would\nkeep Hungary an unattractive market in the next few years.\"We are still loss-making, but last year our loss was\nsignificantly lower than a year earlier or before,\" Wiedner was\nquoted as saying in an interview with website portfolio.hu.But the pressure on the banks from the government, combined\nwith the European Central Bank (ECB) asset quality review, the\nfindings of which are due to be published by November, could be\na trigger for some banks to leave, some sources said.\"At the moment they (the government) are looking at what\nthis ECB review leads to because maybe opportunities will arise\nin Hungary even though some banks say now they are not leaving,\"\nan EU diplomat said on condition of anonymity.\"They want not necessarily to own all the banks but to push\nbanks to contribute more to stimulate growth.\""], "2014/01/28/oly-iceh-m-preview-idUSL5N0KY3G420140128": ["PREVIEW-Olympics-Ice hockey-Russia eyes show-stopping finish", "2014/01/28", "Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russia president Vladimir Putin can only hope and dream that the country's men's ice hockey team can deliver the show-stopping golden finish to the Sochi Olympics that Canada did four years ago.As final acts go, the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games will be hard to top with Sidney Crosby scoring the winning goal against the United States to crown Canada Olympic hockey champions hours before the closing ceremonies.The victory added one last glorious gold to a Winter Games record haul of 14 and fittingly the milestone medal was the one that mattered more than any other to hockey-mad Canadians.If there is one country in the world where the sport matters as much as it does to Canadians, it is Russia and Putin would like nothing more than to bring the curtain down on the most expensive Olympics ever with a chest-thumping party sweeping across the massive nation's nine time zones.Certainly Russian hockey fans are ready to party, having had precious little to celebrate since the breakup of the former Soviet Union.Once international hockey's undisputed superpower, Russia's dominance has faded.Winners of six of seven Olympic titles from the 1964 Innsbruck Games to Calgary in 1988, the last traces of the mighty Russian hockey empire were seen at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games when a \"Unified Team\" of former Soviet republics took the gold.In the five Winter Olympics since, Russia has had to settle for one silver and a bronze while slumping to a new low in Vancouver with a sixth place finish.Russian hockey players, led by National Hockey League three-time most valuable player Alexander Ovechkin, come to Sochi on a gold medal mission.In many ways Ovechkin is not just the face of Russian hockey, he is the face of the Sochi Olympics, a proud Russian who was prepared to defy the NHL and risk his $124 million contract with the Washington Capitals to be part of the 2014 Winter Games.While the NHL waffled on whether it would continue its Olympic participation, Ovechkin had no such hesitation declaring no matter what the league decided, he had made his decision and would be in Sochi.\"It's all about the gold,\" Ovechkin told Reuters. \"We have a goal to win the gold medal and we're going to try to win it.\"I can't wait. I'm excited and nervous but right now I'm trying not to concentrate about it.\"I'm pretty sure it's going to be really interesting and great fun. Fun and interesting is one part but we have to win.\"While Putin suited up and practiced with a Continental Hockey League team, Canadian Prime Minster Stephen Harper was putting the finishing touches on a hockey book that was published last year.Canada will try to write another feel-good ending of their own like they did in Vancouver as they go for a third gold in four Winter Games.Once again, Canada will be led by a rejuvenated Crosby, \"Sid the Kid\", back at the peak of his powers and the NHL scoring table, after missing large chunks of two seasons recovering from concussion woes.Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock, who steered Canada to gold in 2010, is back behind the bench and ready to be the most scrutinized, second-guessed Canadian in Sochi.\"It's different when you represent your country,\" said Babcock. \"It's a special, special thing that happens every four years and everyone who gets a chance to be involved whether you are a therapist, an Olympian or a medallist, it's a thrill of a lifetime.\"Not to be overlooked is the United States, who will ice a motivated team that includes 13 players that lost in such cruel heart-breaking fashion in Vancouver.The Americans have not won gold since the 1980 Lake Placid Miracle on Ice but should be among the contenders again after runner-up finishes at two of the last three Winter Games.The big international ice has presented big problems for both the Canadian and U.S. teams packed with NHLers, who grew up playing the game on the smaller surface.With more room to maneuver, speed and creativity are at a premium on the larger Sochi ice rather than the tight-checking physical style seen at NHL arenas.Canada and the U.S. have met in the finals of the last two Winter Games staged on the smaller ice but since the 1998 Nagano Olympics, the first to allow NHLers, neither country has reached the podium when the tournament has been played on bigger ice.Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic will all fancy their medal chances on the larger surface.The Czech Republic stunned the hockey world by taking gold at Nagano while the Swedes were crowned Olympic champions in 1994 and 2006.Finland will also be in the medal hunt having reached the podium at four of the last five Games.Some of international hockey's biggest names will take one final stab at Olympic glory in Sochi.The Anaheim Ducks' Teemu Selanne, the 43-year-old Finnish Flash, will be appearing in a sixth Olympics, while 41-year-old Jaromir Jagr, a member of the Czech Republic's gold medal winning team in 1998, and 41-year-old Swede Daniel Alfredsson, a gold medal winner in 2006, will both be lacing the skates up for their fifth Winter Games.

This market, too, has witnessed a rise in \n      demand. Contract sterilization services, in particular, is a common \n      trend due to stringent regulatory requirements imposed by regulatory \n      agencies like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and \n      Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). \n      Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), hence, prefer outsourcing, as \n      it reduces costs on sterilizing and disinfecting equipment in-house by \n      focusing on their other business core competencies.However, in the near future, in-house sterilization is expected to give \n      healthy competition to contract sterilization services mainly due to the \n      advent of hydrogen gas plasma and vapor hydrogen peroxide that are \n      preferred to be used in-house. It also offers better quality assurance \n      with just-in-time facility for sterilized products. Gamma and E-beam \n      types of sterilization services are poised to have better growth over \n      EtO in the near future due to their wider application with respect to \n      sterilization of food, pharmaceutical, medical devices, life sciences, \n      and cosmetic products.Along with sterilization, cleaning and sanitation are also important \n      activities carried out in healthcare, food, and pharmaceutical industry. \n      Hand disinfectant market is the fastest growing segment as hands are \n      considered to be the primary cause of cross infection.Key Topics Covered:1 Introduction2 Executive Summary3 Market Overview4 Global Sterilization Equipment Market5 In-House & Contract Sterilization Markets6 Global Sterilization Application Market7 Global Disinfection Market8 Geographic Analysis For Infection Control Market9 Competitive Landscape Of Infection Control Companies10 Company ProfilesCompanies Mentioned:3M CompanyAdvanced Sterilization Products ServicesAhlstrom CorporationBelimedCisaGetinge GroupHoneywell InternationalKimberly-ClarkMatachana GroupMedivatorsMmmNordionSakura Global HoldingSteris CorporationSterigenics InternationalSynergy HealthTso3For more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/v892zz/infection_controlResearch and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comU.S. \n      Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716Sector:Healthcare \n      and Medical Devices,Infectious \n      Diseases"], "2014/01/28/ny-fitch-ratings-equity-idUSnBw285984a+100+BSW20140128": ["Fitch: Positive Equity Doesn't Prevent All U.S. Foreclosures", "2014/01/28", "Fitch: Positive Equity Doesn't Prevent All U.S. ForeclosuresRecent U.S. home price growth has been insufficient to help borrowers \n      still struggling to pay their mortgages, according to Fitch Ratings. \n      Evidence of this is in the growing percentage of borrowers entering \n      foreclosure with positive equity in their homes.Fitch estimates that the percentage of borrowers entering foreclosure \n      with positive equity has roughly doubled in the last two years. While \n      equity continues to be an important factor for borrower payment \n      behavior, income and ability to pay are key drivers as well.It is clear that rising home prices have had a positive influence on \n      borrower behavior. However, some portion of borrowers still exhibit an \n      inability to recover as the economy has moderately improved. This seems \n      particularly evident in many of the RMBS loans that have been entering \n      into the foreclosure process over the past few years. In many cases, \n      troubled borrowers with equity are unable to sell their properties \n      because the proceeds of the sale would not be enough to cover the \n      mortgage amount, the closing costs, and the backlog of missed payments. \n      Loans entering foreclosure today have missed roughly two years of \n      payments on average, more than double the pre-crisis, long term average.The changing composition of borrowers entering foreclosure may also help \n      explain why those with positive equity continue to struggle. The \n      percentage of loans entering foreclosure which had been cash-out \n      refinances at origination increased steadily since 2008, and now \n      accounts for 50% of the total. Today's tighter loan underwriting and \n      origination guidelines may prevent many of these borrowers from tapping \n      the equity in their homes to cover expenses. Although equity may exist, \n      the current guidelines are in most cases restrictive for borrowers with \n      poor credit history. Also, the loan-to-value and cash-out dollar limits \n      are significantly lower than what was available during peak-vintage \n      years and, despite the improved equity situation, few of these \n      delinquent borrowers could materially benefit from further cash-out \n      refinancings.Furthermore, approximately half of all loans that recently entered \n      foreclosure had been unsuccessful in at least one prior loan \n      modification. The percentage of loans entering foreclosure that had been \n      underwritten to subprime guidelines has increased as well. Such \n      attributes suggest that many of these borrowers were either \n      overleveraged at origination or had payment challenges in prior years \n      and have few alternatives now and may be able to remain in the home \n      until the foreclosure process is complete.The age of loans entering foreclosure also continues to climb steadily. \n      Borrowers recently entering foreclosure have loans that are roughly \n      eight years seasoned on average, compared to the pre-crisis average of \n      two-to-three years. As such, loans with positive equity that are \n      entering foreclosure today may be more adversely selected due to the \n      length of time prior to entering foreclosure and the potential for \n      disrepair.It is possible that some portion of borrowers currently in the \n      foreclosure process obtained additional and/or secondary financing \n      subsequent to the origination of their first liens. The additional \n      leverage could also be a factor in their ability/willingness to pay and \n      whether the borrower is in a positive equity position. These factors are \n      important considerations for the mortgage loan servicers, who must \n      determine the best resolution for the borrower and property, while \n      assessing the ultimate impact on investors.Under the existing regulatory framework, residential mortgage servicers \n      have many tools at their disposal to help struggling homeowners. \n      However, servicers are often left with few options other than \n      foreclosure for borrowers who are unable to make regularly scheduled \n      mortgage payments, despite their interest in remaining in their homes. \n      This is especially true in situations where borrowers have equity in the \n      property and have payment problems even after loan modifications \n      involving significant rate reductions.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND \n      DISCLAIMERS.

They wanted to be able to look at each game in a visualization that would tell them at a glance what happened. In the course of a week, this new chart and application was born. \u00c2Tommy Rausch, leader of the creative team at Infragistics, explained, \"Each game is split into 4 quarters and within each quarter, the ball is moved forward by a team. We looked at that idea and came up with a chart that shows how long each team had possession, what happened at the end of that possession and we quickly found this brand new way of seeing a game.\"Stephen Zaharuk, a lead developer at Infragistics, built the chart and the application. \"I was amazed how quickly we were able to turn Tommy's prototypes into a real application. I built it initially in our iOS controls. We have a tool that converts our controls across computing platforms so we're going to have this new chart control available across all of our platforms including Windows Forms, HTML5/Jquery, MVC, ASP.NET and WPF,\" said Stephen.The applicability of this visualization to business scenarios is very clear. As in football, most companies operate on quarters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fiscal quarters. And most companies are monitoring progress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but instead of watching a football, they are wanting to visualize the progress of a product or salesperson. And with this new visualization, it's as easy to see the performance ofMarshawn Lynchas it is to see the growth in Sales in 2014.For businesses that want to visualize data in new and unique ways, Infragistics will be providing this patent pending control in upcoming versions of Infragistics Ultimate\u00e2\u20ac\u201c for Web developers with HTML 5, for iOS developers with native controls and for ASP.NET, Windows Forms and WPF developers.The iPad and iPhone versions of SBViz will be available on the Apple App store for free later this week and more details can be found atwww.sbviz.com.About Infragistics\u00c2A worldwide leader in user experience helping developers build stunning apps, Infragistics is trusted by over a million developers for enterprise-ready user interface toolsets that deliver high-performance applications for Web, Windows and mobile applications while also offering design tools for rapid, interactive prototyping.

Forwards Andrea Bargnani (elbow), Amar'e Stoudemire (ankle) and Kenyon Martin (ankle) are all sidelined, leaving the Knicks short on frontcourt depth and secondary scorers.

Besides serving the interests of the\ntwo countries, we hope our dialogue (with Turkey) serve regional\ninterests as well,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh\nAfkham told reporters in Tehran.\"As two neighbours and Muslim countries, Iran and Turkey\nenjoy many commonalities and many cooperation opportunities.\"Analysts said the main focus of Erdogan's visit was\nexpanding economic cooperation, finessing any political disputes\nfor now. \"Considering that the economy and energy ministers are\naccompanying Erdogan, we can say this trip is\nbusiness-targeted,\" said Tehran-based analyst Hossein Foroughi.Erdogan signed three trade deals on Wednesday before leaving\nTehran to fly home, Iranian state television said.\"Today we had a good chance to review bilateral ties,\"\nErdogan said in remarks translated into Farsi by Iranian\ntelevision as it showed him meeting Vice President Eshaq\nJahangiri.\"I would like to mention specifically, and to express my\nsatisfaction with, the agreement we signed in the preferential\ntrade field,\" he said. \"It is obvious that we import from Iran\ncrude oil and gas, which are strategic energy sources, and we\n(will be) able to increase the volume of these imports.\"No details were immediately released about the three trade\npacts or Erdogan's meetings with Khamenei and Rouhani, who plans\nto visit Turkey within the next few months, according to Iranian\nand Turkish media.SEEKING NATURAL GAS DISCOUNTErdogan's delegation repeated Turkey's demand for a discount\non the price of natural gas from Iran, a senior Turkish official\nsaid. A senior Iranian official then told Reuters: \"This issue\nwas discussed but further talks will take place on the issue of\ndiscount. No decision has been made yet.\"Turkey depends on imports for almost all of its natural gas\nneeds and the $60 billion energy bill Ankara must foot annually\nhas been the biggest driver of its ballooning current account\ndeficit, regarded as the main weakness of its economy.Ankara deems Iranian gas too expensive compared with other\nsuppliers like Russia and Azerbaijan, an assertion rejected by\nTehran. Turkey's Petroleum Pipeline Corporation applied to an\ninternational court of arbitration in 2012 for a ruling on \nIran's gas pricing. The case is still pending.Turkey is keen to increase oil and gas imports from Tehran\nin anticipation of sanctions against Iran's huge energy sector\nbeing dismantled in the wake of the Nov. 24 deal between Tehran\nand six big powers under which the Islamic Republic committed to\nscaling back some of its controversial nuclear activities.Some sanctions that were imposed over suspicions that Iran\nis covertly trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability,\nsomething it denies, were relaxed starting on Jan. 20.But most sanctions, including a severe squeeze on Iran's\naccess to the international financial system, remain in force\npending a long-term agreement on the scope of Iran's nuclear\nprogramme, which is to be negotiated over the next six months.POTENTIAL MARKET BONANZA IN IRANBut the potential of a market of 76 million people in Iran\nwith some of the world's biggest oil and gas reserves is a\nmagnet for foreign investors, including Turkish companies.\"We hope the process will be finalised with an agreement\nthat will ensure the removal of all sanctions on Iran. Turkey\nhas so far done its best in that regard and will continue to do\nso,\" Erdogan told reporters in Ankara before he flew to Tehran.Iranian officials say trade between the countries stood at\n$22 billion (16.2 billion euros) in 2012, before dipping to $20\nbillion in 2013, and that it should reach $30 billion in 2015.Iran was Turkey's third largest export market in 2012. In\nfact, Iranian media said, Turkey exports more than 20,000\nproducts to Iran, among them gold and silver.The United States has been unhappy over continued trade with\nIran by its Turkish ally sidestepping the sanctions regime, and\nhas blacklisted some Turkish firms involved.U.S. Treasury Under Secretary David Cohen, who visited\nTurkey just before Erdogan's Iran trip, warned the Turkish\ngovernment against any rapid improvement of trade and economic\nlinks with the Islamic Republic before a final nuclear agreement\nis struck, according to Turkish media.\"Businesses interested in engaging in Iran really should\nhold off. The day may come when Iran is open for business, but\nthe day is not today,\" Zaman newspaper quoted Cohen as saying.\n\n (Additional reporting by Orhan Coskun andHumeyra Pamuk,\nEditing by Mark Heinrich)"], "2014/01/29/ca-wra-san-diego-idUSnPnLAnsTwQ+165+PRN20140129": ["WRA is Open for Environmental Consulting in San Diego", "2014/01/29", "SAN RAFAEL, Calif.,Jan. 29, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2WRAis excited to announce the opening of a new office inSan Diego. \u00c2\u00a0WRA has opened the office to support ongoing work inSouthern Californiaand increase its ability to quickly service nearby projects.

(NASDAQ:FLWS), the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading florist and \n      gift shop, today reported total net revenues from continuing operations \n      of $266.3 million for its fiscal 2014 second quarter ended December 29, \n      2013, compared with revenues from continuing operations of $251.4 \n      million in the prior year period. The Company said the 6.0 percent \n      increase, or $15.0 million, reflected growth across all three of its \n      business segments, led by its Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, \n      which grew 6.1 percent, or $8.5 million, to $149.6 million compared with \n      $141.1 million in the prior year period.Gross profit margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 41.7 \n      percent, compared with 41.6 percent in the prior year period, primarily \n      reflecting a 180 basis point improvement in its BloomNet wire service \n      segment and a 20 basis point improvement in its Gourmet Food and Gift \n      Baskets segment. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue was 30.9 \n      percent, consistent with the prior year period.As a result, EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation expense, \n      increased 7.0 percent to $34.9 million, compared with EBITDA of $32.6 \n      million in the prior year period. Income from continuing operations \n      increased 6.2 percent to $17.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, \n      compared with $16.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the prior \n      year period.

We are particularly pleased with the results in our Gourmet \n      Food and Gift Baskets segment, where our mass market gift baskets \n      business again showed double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and our \n      Fannie May Fine Chocolates business rebounded nicely from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      operational challenges. Overall, the Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets \n      segment achieved solid growth in revenues and gross margin while \n      reducing operating expenses as a percent of revenue, thereby driving a \n      significantly enhanced bottom-line contribution for the quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe Company also reported solid customer metrics for the quarter. For \n      the quarter, the Company attracted 637,000 new customers. Approximately \n      1.6 million customers placed orders during the quarter, of whom 61 \n      percent were repeat customers. This reflects the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effective \n      marketing programs, including initiatives in social and mobile \n      communication channels to engage with its customers and deepen its \n      relationships as their trusted Florist and Gift Shop for all of their \n      celebratory occasions.McCann noted that, in addition to finishing its fiscal second quarter \n      with approximately zero net debt on its balance sheet, the Company has \n      continued to buy back its stock, spending approximately $6.5 million on \n      share repurchases since the start of the fiscal year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a strong \n      balance sheet and we anticipate growing our cash position during the \n      second half of our fiscal year. Combined with our highly flexible credit \n      line, we are well positioned to invest to grow our business and build \n      shareholder value. As we continue to grow our cash flows, we see stock \n      repurchases as an effective means of providing value for our \n      shareholders and we expect to continue to be in the market, \n      opportunistically buying back shares, during the second half of fiscal \n      2014.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdMcCann noted that the second half of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal year, \n      beginning in January, is more floral in nature due to the Valentine, \n      Easter and Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day holidays as well as other spring gifting \n      occasions. He added that the majority of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues and \n      profitability for the second half of the fiscal year would be \n      concentrated in its fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the shift of the \n      Easter holiday into that period versus the prior year when it fell in \n      the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal third quarter.SEGMENT RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS:The Company provides fiscal 2014 second quarter selected financial \n      results for its Consumer Floral, BloomNet and Gourmet Foods and Gift \n      Baskets business segments in the tables attached to this release and as \n      follows:Consumer Floral: Revenues in this segment \n        grew 5.8 percent to $97.1 million compared with $91.8 million in the \n        prior year period. The increase in revenues includes approximately \n        $3.5 million resulting from the consolidation of the operating results \n        of iFlorist, a UK floral gift provider in which the Company increased \n        its investment to a majority position during second quarter of fiscal \n        2014. Gross profit margin for the quarter was 38.8 percent, down 40 \n        basis points compared with the prior year period, due to the impact of \n        lower margins associated with the aforementioned iFlorist business. \n        Adjusted for this impact, gross profit margin for the segment \n        increased 10 basis points, reflecting enhanced sourcing and \n        distribution logistics as well as a disciplined approach to \n        promotional marketing. Segment contribution margin was $8.7 million, \n        compared with $10.3 million in the prior year period, primarily \n        reflecting a higher marketing expense ratio during the period. The \n        increase in marketing costs included investments in social and mobile \n        programs designed to engage directly with customers and help drive \n        demand for the upcoming spring floral holiday season, including the \n        Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Easter and Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day holidays. (The Company defines \n        Segment Contribution Margin as earnings before interest, taxes, \n        depreciation and amortization and before allocation of corporate \n        overhead expenses.)BloomNet Wire Service: Revenues increased \n        6.3 percent to $19.9 million compared with $18.7 million in the prior \n        year period, reflecting continued gains in market penetration for the \n        Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanded suite of products and services for professional \n        florists. Gross margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to \n        54.1 percent compared with 52.3 percent in the prior year period. \n        Segment contribution margin increased 7.9 percent to $6.5 million \n        compared with $6.0 million in the prior year period.Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets: Revenues \n        increased 6.1 percent to $149.6 million compared with $141.1 million \n        in the prior year period. This was driven primarily by the continued \n        rebound in gift baskets sales into the Mass Market channel as well as \n        solid ecommerce growth in the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cheryl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bakery gifts \n        business. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 41.7 percent \n        reflecting the revenue growth as well as operational improvements in \n        the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fannie May business. Segment contribution margin \n        increased 12.5 percent to $31.0 million compared with $27.6 million in \n        the prior year period, reflecting the growth in revenues and gross \n        margin, combined with operational leverage.Company Guidance:The Company reiterated its top- and bottom-line guidance for fiscal \n      2014, saying it continues to expect to achieve revenue growth across all \n      three of its business segments with consolidated revenue growth for the \n      year anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. Also, based on \n      anticipated continued improvements in gross profit margin and operating \n      leverage, the Company expects to achieve EBITDA and EPS growth at rates \n      exceeding revenue growth. The Company also anticipates generating Free \n      Cash Flow for the year of approximately $20 million.McCann said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the second half of fiscal 2014, we expect to continue \n      the solid growth trends that we have seen over the past several years. \n      We will also continue to invest in key strategic initiatives that can \n      deepen the relationships we have with our customers and thereby provide \n      long-term growth opportunities. Some of the initiatives we are most \n      excited about are our industry leading efforts in Mobile and Social \n      commerce, new product offerings such as FruitBouquets and Fannie May \n      Chocolate Dipped Berries and our new cloud-based, retail technology \n      system for BloomNet florists. We believe these efforts, and others \n      underway, will help us deliver smiles for our customers and build \n      shareholder value.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdDefinitions:* EBITDA: Net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, \n      amortization.Free Cash Flow: net cash provided by operating \n      activities less capital expenditures.Category contribution margin: \n      earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before \n      the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. The Company presents \n      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations because it \n      considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its \n      performance and believes such information is frequently used by the \n      investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. \n      The Company also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as factors used to \n      determine the total amount of incentive compensation available to be \n      awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit \n      agreement uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with \n      covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and \n      Adjusted EBITDA are also used by the Company to evaluate and price \n      potential acquisition candidates. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash \n      Flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered \n      in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as \n      reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted \n      EBITDA are: (a) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or \n      cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA \n      and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or \n      the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal \n      payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and \n      amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and \n      amortized may have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not \n      reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA and \n      Free Cash Flow should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with \n      GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance.About 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading florist and gift shop. \n      For more than 35 years, 1-800-FLOWERS\u00c2\u00ae (1-800-356-9377 orwww.1800flowers.com) \n      has been helping deliver smiles for our customers with gifts for every \n      occasion, including fresh flowers and the finest selection of plants, \n      gift baskets, gourmet foods, confections, candles, balloons and plush \n      stuffed animals.

In order to leverage the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n          infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized \n          management platform, providing support services throughout the \n          organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the \n          Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above \n          categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses \n          as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.\u00c2(**)Performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or \n          segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable \n          revenue and operating expenses of the segments. As such, \n          management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of profitability for these segments does not \n          include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, \n          depreciation and amortization, other income (net), nor does it \n          include one-time charges or gains. Management utilizes EBITDA, and \n          adjusted financial information, as a performance measurement tool \n          because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental \n          measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the \n          investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable \n          market capitalization. The Company also uses EBITDA and adjusted \n          financial information as one of the factors used to determine the \n          total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive \n          officers and other employees. The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit agreement uses \n          EBITDA and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with \n          covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and \n          adjusted financial information is also used by the Company to \n          evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. EBITDA and \n          adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical \n          tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute \n          for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some \n          of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or \n          cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) \n          EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the \n          cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal \n          payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and \n          amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and \n          amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not \n          reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because \n          of these limitations, EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental \n          basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's \n          performance.\u00c2Click \n      here to subscribe to Mobile Alerts for 1-800-Flowers.1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.Investor:Joseph \n      D.

The same year, Ellison and his colleagues founded the database company that would eventually be renamed Oracle.In an interview with CBS News' Charlie Rose in August, Ellison said he believed the NSA's widespread surveillance was essential to preventing terrorism.(Additional reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Matt Driskill)"], "2014/01/29/dc-spi-plastics-grow-idUSnPnPHnvxyq+160+PRN20140129": ["U.S. Plastics Manufacturing Continues Positive Growth", "2014/01/29", "WASHINGTON,Jan. 29, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade Association, which represents the nation's third largest manufacturing industry, supports President Obama's efforts to create jobs and strengthen the middle class by expanding the economy and negotiating sensible trade agreements.An in-depth data analysis of the plastics industry's 2012 performance globally and in the U.S. is detailed in the newly released reports titled, \"The Definition, Size and Impact of the U.S. Plastics Industry,\" and \"Global Business Trends, Partners, Hot Products.\"\"Plastics continue to rank higher than the rest of the U.S. manufacturing sector's key growth areas,\" saidWilliam R.

This claim is rarely backed with economic analysis. In fact, after a project like theChicago parking meter dealis in place, it is often discovered that the project is bad economics for taxpayers.P3s are not all one-size-fits-all. Public advocacy group\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the Public Interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbreaks them down into these categories:Long-Term Lease Agreement- This is an agreement where a private company (or consortium of companies) receives the right to collect revenues associated with an existing asset in exchange for an upfront fee to the governmental entity. Examples of this model include the long-term leases of the Chicago parking meters [or the near bankrupt Indiana Toll Road].Sale/Leaseback- A sale-leaseback is a transaction in which the owner, in this case the government, sells public property and then leases it back from the private buyer. Examples of this model include the recently proposed and rejected sale/leaseback of numerous California state office buildings.Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain- There are many variations of this model, such as Design-Build, Design-Build-Operate, etc., depending on the private entity\u2019s role. In this model, a private entity is involved in varying aspects of the financing, design, building, operation and maintenance of the asset, and is compensated for its investment by receiving the right to collect future revenues associated with asset, such as user fees [ie tolls].Availability Payment- In this model, the governmental entity provides regular payments, based on criteria such as project milestones or performance standards, to private investors, developers, and operators that design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the asset (or perform a subset of these activities). This project is similar to the design, build, finance, operate, and maintain-type contract described above, but uses an availability payment scheme to compensate the private companies.Some of these P3 models might be useful for communities and states as they consider monetizing existing facilities or adding new infrastructure. Any time a government considers privatizing infrastructure, it should conduct economic analysis and make it publicly available.A common financing issue is that P3s are almost always structured with a BBB- rating, which rewards bondholders, but penalizes citizens. Most public agencies can get the necessary financing at a AA or even A rating, which is an enormous saving over a 25-30 year bond issue.A proposed bridge project today, theBrent Spence Bridge, will connect Indiana and Kentucky. Although there is a lot of documentation for the project, it is not clear what the economic advantage is for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153availability payment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd model that was chosen.In this model, private firms will design, build, finance, operate, and maintain this toll bridge and receive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153availability payments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toll authority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over several decades. When you drill down into the available economic analysis, it is not clear that the engineering firm that prepared the analysis understood what the proposed financing costs would be (table 8A2) for public or private borrowers. In fact, it appears that only a day and a half of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workshops\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were convened to evaluate what the cost variables would be for a multi-billion dollar project (page 19).There are still public arguments over the economics of the financing structure for the bridge. In thecommentson aLouisville Courier-Journalarticle this week, thecity commissionerofCovington, KY, Steven Frank, debates theexecutive directorat theKentucky Transportation Cabinet\u00c2\u00a0about the weakness of the complex deal structure for the bridge:Steven L Frank:If the bridges do not generate sufficient cash flow, the Authority itself has no money to ever repay anyone. The State of Kentucky is on the hook for all shortfalls which will come out of every region\u2019s projects. So yes, the whole state should be rightly concerned with the financial engineering done in Louisville as should the local drivers who think that tolls can only increase by CPI or 2.5 percent.The last point is this. The legislature can repudiate its [debt] obligation without harming its own credit rating; but that too comes with a price. Kentucky loses its place to vote its interests on the Authority and the bondholders become debtors in possession and can choose whatever tolls or maintenance program for the bridge that suits them and not the citizens. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about time the citizen of Louisville woke up and realized what was done to you by a bunch of hacks.Too bad that all the legal and financial engineering details Frank cites were not available involuminous public disclosurebefore the bridge project was finalized. Public officials should make their legal and economic analysis available before public revenues are transferred to private entities.Here is why this is important: Steven Frank in another comment highlights the wide number of privatized road, tunnel and bridge P3 projects that have gone bankrupt by overestimating project revenues:To name but a few lessons in overoptimistic projections leading to financial disasters consider the following list: American Toll Road Company which consists for 3 toll roads in Alabama and the Windsor Tunnel connecting Detroit to Canada; bankrupt. The Pocahontas toll road outside Richmond, VA; bankrupt. Dulles Greenway; bankrupt. St Route 91 in California toll road; bankrupt. St. Route 125 in California toll road, Bankrupt. The Foothills-Eastern Orange County toll road, soon to be the second largest municipal bond bankruptcy after Detroit; pending. The Southern Connector outside Greenville South Carolina; bankrupt. Teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, the Indiana Toll Road System and the Sky Loop in Chicago. The Austin Turnpike is also considering bankruptcy as soon as June 2014.Think it is isolated to the USA? Almost every toll road in Spain; bankrupt. The German toll system; bankrupted in 2002, revived and on the brink of insolvency again. Australia, the home of the original movement to begin the modern era of P3 legislation behind the financial legerdemain of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of Goldman Sachs, Macquarie; there are multiple bankruptcies. I will list in an appendage web sites that document the financial carnage.P3s may be a good model for public assets, but their history is uneven. Taxpayers and citizens must have economic analysis to judge if a public private partnership is in the public interest before the final contracts are signed."], "2014/01/29/ca-carefusion-terumo-idUSnPnLAncJhY+165+PRN20140129": [0, "2014/01/29", "SAN DIEGO,Jan. 29, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- CareFusion (NYSE:CFN), a leading global medical technology company, and Terumo Corporation, the largest medical technology company inJapan, today announced an exclusive, eight-year agreement for CareFusion to co-brand, market and distribute Terumo's SurFlash\u00c2\u00aeline of safety peripheral IV catheters for the acute care segment acrossthe United States.The agreement includes both SurFlash and SurFlash Plus Safety IV Catheters, which are proven to improve the success of catheter placement on the first attempt by an average of 20 percent.

There is no national standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data breaches must advise their customers and agencies like the U.S. Secret Service and FBI.HOLDER CONFIRMS PROBEHolder, testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the Justice Department would seek the perpetrators of the Target breach as well as \"any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card fraud.\"\"While we generally do not discuss specific matters under investigation, I can confirm the department is investigating the breach involving the U.S. retailer, Target,\" Holder said.Target has said a breach of its networks resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers.The Secret Service has taken the lead investigating the recently revealed data breaches at Target and other retailers, including Neiman Marcus and Michaels Companies Inc, the largest U.S. arts and crafts retailer.Reuters reported on January 23 that the FBI also warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases over the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target during the holiday shopping season.Numerous congressional committees are accelerating efforts to gather more information about the data breaches.Democrat Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took a new tack this week, asking Target why the company had not yet reported its data breach to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\"Your failure thus far to provide this information to your investors does not seem consistent with the spirit or the letter of the SEC's financial disclosure rules,\" Rockefeller wrote in the three-page letter to Target's chief executive.Target closed at $56.89 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, down 1.7 percent, after reaching its lowest level since July 2012.In the House of Representatives, Democratic members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked Neiman Marcus for documents relating to the upscale retailer's recent cybersecurity breach. Last week, the same lawmakers asked Target executives for more documents related to its massive data breach.Earlier this month, Neiman Marcus said about 1.1 million customer payment cards may have been affected in a breach last year.On Thursday, members of the House Oversight Committee, which has broad investigative jurisdiction, are scheduled to hold a telephone briefing with Target representatives, during which detailed questions are expected to be asked about how and why recent data breaches occurred.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder did not give details on upcoming meetings but reiterated that Target was \"continuing to work with elected officials to keep them informed and updated as our investigation continues.\"Three Congressional panels are slated to hold hearings, beginning next week. On Monday, the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to hear from witnesses representing the Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission, and lobbying groups.On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary committee is expecting to take testimony from Target's chief financial officer.The House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to hold its own hearing next week. Neiman Marcus has been invited to that hearing but the company has not yet confirmed its attendance, said a spokeswoman for the panel's top Democrat, Henry Waxman.A Neiman Marcus representative did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.(Additional reporting bySusan Heavey,Alina SelyukhandJim Finkle; Editing byHoward Goller,Ros Krasny,Bernadette BaumandTom Brown)"], "2014/01/29/nc-harris-teeter-idUSnBw295239a+100+BSW20140129": [0, "2014/01/29", "Kroger Completes Merger with Harris TeeterThe Kroger Co.

Under the terms of the \n      merger agreement, Harris Teeter shareholders will receive $49.38 per \n      share of Harris Teeter common stock.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased that our merger is complete and look forward to bringing \n      together the best of Kroger and Harris Teeter to benefit our customers, \n      associates and shareholders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said W. Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive \n      Officer of Kroger. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This merger brings the exceptional Harris Teeter \n      brand and a complementary base of stores in attractive markets to the \n      Kroger family. We have long respected Harris Teeter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer \n      orientation, friendly and professional associates, strong management \n      team, and company values \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are consistent with ours. Together, \n      through our Customer 1stStrategy, we are going to be an \n      outstanding combination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThomas W. Dickson, the outgoing Chairman and CEO of Harris Teeter \n      Supermarkets, Inc., stated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are excited that Kroger, one of the best \n      food retailers in the U.S., has recognized the value in Harris Teeter. \n      This successful transaction is, first and foremost, a tribute to our \n      outstanding management teams and associates. Their tireless commitment \n      to delivering great value and excellent customer service has been \n      instrumental in building Harris Teeter into the unique brand that it is \n      today. The merger with Kroger provides the opportunity to continue to \n      expand the Harris Teeter brand as well as to provide future employment \n      and career advancement opportunities for our associates in an \n      increasingly competitive market. The merger also is the culmination of a \n      long track record of delivering substantial value to our shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe transaction allows Kroger to expand with the prestigious Harris \n      Teeter brand and a base of 227 stores in the fast-growing and attractive \n      southeastern and mid-Atlantic markets and in Washington, D.C. Harris \n      Teeter also operates distribution centers for grocery, frozen and \n      perishable foods in Greensboro, NC and Indian Trail, NC and a dairy \n      facility in High Point, NC. Harris Teeter will continue to operate its \n      stores under the Harris Teeter brand name as a subsidiary of The Kroger \n      Co. Harris Teeter had revenues of $4.7 billion for fiscal year 2013.Financial HighlightsKroger financed the transaction through a combination of debt issued in \n      December 2013 and commercial paper. Although Kroger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net debt to EBITDA \n      ratio increased due to the merger close, the company expects to allocate \n      some free cash flow to debt reduction to re-establish and maintain its \n      2.00 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2.20 net debt to EBITDA ratio over the next 18-24 months. Kroger \n      is committed to maintaining its current investment grade credit rating. \n      In addition, consistent with its long-term commitment to returning cash \n      to shareholders, Kroger intends to continue its quarterly dividend and \n      share repurchase program while managing free cash flow to reduce the \n      leverage taken on in this merger.Including the effect of allocating some free cash flow to debt \n      reduction, Kroger continues to expect net accretion to earnings per \n      diluted share in the range of $0.06 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $0.09 in the first full year after \n      the merger, excluding transition and transaction expenses, after taking \n      into account the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current 8-11% long-term net earnings per \n      diluted share growth rate. Kroger expects to achieve cost savings of \n      approximately $40 to $50 million, largely from the benefits of Kroger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \n      enhanced scale, within the next four years.As of January 28, 2014, shares of Harris Teeter common stock ceased to \n      trade on the New York Stock Exchange.Operational ProfileTogether, the company will operate 2,641 supermarkets and employ more \n      than 368,000 associates across 34 states and the District of Columbia. \n      Harris Teeter will continue to operate its stores as a subsidiary of The \n      Kroger Co. and will continue to be led by Harris Teeter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \n      president, Fred Morganthall.

These \n      statements are indicated by words such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plans,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n      \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intends,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153committed to,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our ability to achieve earnings per \n      share growth rate expectations may be affected by: labor disputes, \n      particularly as Kroger seeks to manage health care and pension costs; \n      industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing \n      and new competitors, including nontraditional competitors, the \n      aggressiveness of competition, and our response to these activities; \n      unexpected changes in product costs; the state of the economy, including \n      interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain \n      commodities; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their \n      purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions as well as fuel \n      and food prices; the number of shares outstanding; the success of our \n      future growth plans; goodwill impairment; changes in government funded \n      benefit programs; volatility in our fuel margins; the effect of fuel \n      costs on consumer spending; the effect of prescription drugs going off \n      patent has on our sales and earnings; our expectations regarding our \n      ability to obtain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors; and \n      our ability to generate sales at desirable margins, as well as the \n      success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without \n      fuel. In addition, any delays in opening new stores, failure to achieve \n      tonnage growth as expected, or changes in the economic climate, could \n      cause us to fall short of our earnings targets. Earnings also may be \n      affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that \n      adverse weather conditions and natural disasters disrupt our operations \n      or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or \n      increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or \n      materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or \n      raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including \n      the cost of transportation; and the benefits that we receive from the \n      consolidation of the UFCW pension plans. Our expectations regarding the \n      accretion to earnings to be generated by the merger, and the timing of \n      that accretion, depends primarily on the factors identified above as \n      well as the synergies that are generated by the merger resulting in cost \n      savings, as well as the accuracy of our modeling that assisted us in \n      determining the appropriate acquisition price. Our expected cost savings \n      from the transaction, as well as the timing of that cost savings, will \n      depend on our ability to integrate Harris Teeter into our organization \n      in a timely fashion, including synergies anticipated by reduction of \n      duplicative systems and processes.Our objective to maintain a \n      particular net total debt to EBITDA ratio by allocating free cash flow \n      to debt reduction will be affected by unanticipated increases in net \n      total debt, our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels \n      anticipated, and our failure to generate expected earnings; and the \n      extent to which that ratio will support our current investment grade \n      rating depends on how the rating agencies view our overall financial \n      condition. Our intention to continue our quarterly dividend and share \n      repurchase programs depend primarily on the factors identified above \n      that will generate earnings growth and free cash flow, as well as, with \n      respect to our share repurchase program, the price at which our common \n      shares trade. Our expectation regarding the operation of the Harris \n      Teeter stores will depend on the successful integration of those stores \n      into our organization. These forward-looking statements are subject to \n      uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to \n      differ materially.

Company leadership identified early on that an all-flash array, because of its high-performance capability, was the necessary element for WHOA.com to achieve the service level agreement (SLA) needs of its DaaS offering. In addition to performance, WHOA.com needed a flexible storage solution that allowed it to align its backend storage infrastructure to meet current and future needs. Three features it specifically needed the flash solution to offer included: inline and high-performance data reduction, support of multiple storage networking protocols, and non-disruptive scalability.\"We selected Nimbus Data's Gemini all-flash array after extensive review and consideration of the key players in the all-flash industry,\" saidYunexy Eloy, Chief Information Officer for WHOA.com. \"The Gemini array far exceeded our performance and long-term infrastructure requirements\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere really wasn't a close comparison. Our traditional storage array generated less than one quarter of the IOPS of the Nimbus Gemini all-flash array\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's easily 8x faster. The Gemini array is a truly comprehensive all-flash storage solution that we couldn't find anywhere else.\"WHOA.com immediately took advantage of the inline deduplication capability of the Nimbus HALO operating system, which reduced the amount of actual storage capacity used by the virtual machines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwithout impacting performance. Additionally, Nimbus Data's modular architecture allowed WHOA.com to initially configure the array so that it hosts about 4,000 virtual desktops, with the capability to scale up to 100,000 desktops. \u00c2\u00a0With Nimbus Data's support of multiple storage networking protocols within its Gemini arrays, WHOA.com can seamlessly transition from network file system (NFS) to Fibre Channel as appropriate, without any new hardware investments.\"WHOA.com is well-positioned in the burgeoning cloud services industry, providing their customers with a fast and reliable DaaS offering\u00e2\u20ac\u201done that is achieved through implementation of a full-featured all-flash storage foundation,\" saidThomas Isakovich, CEO and Founder of Nimbus Data. \"It's exciting to see customers like WHOA.com, who have thoroughly vetted our technology and customer support, entrust the foundation of their core business to Nimbus Data.\"To learn more about WHOA.com's deployment of the Nimbus Data Gemini F600 all-flash storage array, read the case study at:http://www.nimbusdata.com/resources/casestudies.php.About Nimbus DataNimbus Data develops an award-winning portfolio of all-flash memory storage systems purpose-built for virtualization, databases, cloud infrastructure, and technical computing.

Net income \n      for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $666,000, or $0.22 per diluted \n      share, compared with $1.4\u00c2\u00a0million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the \n      first quarter of fiscal 2013. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal \n      2014 were $14.9 million compared with $21.7 million in the first quarter \n      of fiscal 2013.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Span-America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter sales and earnings were below the record \n      sales level set in the first quarter last fiscal year due primarily to \n      lower sales of consumer bedding products,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stated Jim Ferguson, \n      president and chief executive officer of Span-America. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year, we \n      benefited from a consumer promotion with a large retail customer that \n      generated $5.8 million in sales. This promotion was not repeated in the \n      most recent quarter and resulted in lower consumer sales, reduced gross \n      profit and lower net income compared with the first quarter of last \n      fiscal year.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our outlook for fiscal 2014 is positive for our medical segment due to \n      the expected contribution from new products and continued cross-selling \n      efforts for our beds and therapeutic support surfaces. As previously \n      announced, we expect the growth in our medical business to be offset by \n      the loss of a large retail customer that selected a different supplier \n      in a routine competitive bidding process for their everyday consumer \n      bedding products. We expect the loss of the consumer retail account to \n      lower full fiscal year 2014 earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share \n      compared with fiscal 2013. Since our first quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance was \n      close to our expectations, we remain comfortable with the upper end of \n      the previously announced range as an estimate for our earnings decline \n      in fiscal year 2014. We expect to update that estimate at the end of the \n      second quarter of fiscal 2014,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continued Ferguson.First Quarter ResultsSales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased 31% to $14.9 \n      million compared with $21.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. \n      As previously noted, most of the sales decline came from a seasonal \n      promotion of consumer products that took place in November 2012 and was \n      not repeated in November 2013.Total medical sales decreased 3% to $10.6 million for the first quarter \n      of fiscal 2014 compared with $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2013, \n      primarily due to lower sales of positioners, overlays and seating \n      products. This was partially offset by a 3% sales increase in \n      therapeutic support surfaces, our largest medical product line. This \n      marked our 11thconsecutive quarter-over-quarter sales growth \n      in our therapeutic support surface product line. Sales of therapeutic \n      support surfaces rose to $5.5 million in the first quarter this year \n      compared with $5.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. Most of the \n      growth in this product line came from our PressureGuard\u00c2\u00ae Custom Care\u00c2\u00ae, \n      and Easy Air\u00c2\u00ae support surfaces.In other medical product lines, sales of our M.C. Healthcare products \n      were level at $2.4 million in each first quarter period. Sales of our \n      positioners, overlays, seating and bedside safety products were down 16% \n      during the first quarter due to lower demand. Sales of our Selan\u00c2\u00ae skin \n      care products increased by 13% compared with the first quarter of fiscal \n      2013.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had excellent customer interest in our new Encore\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 bed for the \n      long-term care market, and we expect it to be a growing contributor to \n      our sales in future quarters,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd noted Ferguson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the \n      combination of the Encore bed and our broad line of therapeutic support \n      surfaces to expand our sales opportunities to new and existing \n      customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdTotal custom products sales were down 60% during the first quarter to \n      $4.3 million compared with $10.8 million in the first quarter last year. \n      Our custom products segment consists of consumer bedding and specialty \n      industrial foam products.Consumer bedding sales were down 66% to $3.4 million compared with $10.0 \n      million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November \n      seasonal promotion added $5.8 million to first quarter fiscal 2013 \n      sales. The lack of this promotion in the first quarter this year \n      accounted for 87% of the decrease in consumer bedding sales compared \n      with the first quarter of last year. Excluding the promotion, consumer \n      bedding sales would have been down 20% in the first quarter of fiscal \n      2014 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2013, mostly due to lower \n      volume from a large retail customer. We previously announced that this \n      customer selected a different supplier for their everyday consumer \n      bedding products during a routine competitive bidding process. We expect \n      to make our last shipments to this customer in February 2014 under the \n      current arrangement.In our custom products segment, Internet sales of our consumer bedding \n      products increased 26% to $302,000 from $239,000 in the first quarter \n      last year. Industrial sales increased 16% to $881,000 in the first \n      quarter of this year compared with $763,000 in the first quarter last \n      year. Most of the industrial sales growth was generated from new \n      customers and higher sales to existing customers.The decline in sales of consumer bedding products compared with the \n      first quarter of last fiscal year reduced first quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross profit \n      and net income. Gross profit declined 22% to $4.8 million in the first \n      quarter of fiscal 2014 compared with $6.1 million in the first quarter \n      last year. The gross margin percentage increased to 32.2% in the first \n      quarter this year compared with 28.4% in the same quarter last year and \n      benefited from the shift in sales mix toward the medical segment, which \n      has a higher gross margin than the custom products segment. Medical \n      sales made up 71% of total company sales in the first quarter of fiscal \n      2014 compared with 50% in the first quarter last year.Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 7% compared with the first \n      quarter of last year due primarily to lower shipping costs in the \n      medical segment. R&D expenses were down by 16% compared with the first \n      quarter of last year due to the completion of several new product \n      development projects in the medical segment. Administrative expenses \n      decreased by 4% due mainly to higher income from the cash value of \n      corporate-owned life insurance policies compared with the first quarter \n      of last year.Operating income decreased by 52% to $1.0 million in the first quarter \n      of fiscal 2014 compared with $2.1 million in the first quarter last \n      year. First quarter net income declined 51% to $666,000, or $0.22 per \n      diluted share, compared with $1.4 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, \n      in the first quarter last year. The first quarter earnings decline was \n      due primarily to lower sales volume of consumer bedding products.Future Outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect modest growth in medical segment sales and earnings during \n      the remainder of fiscal 2014,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continued Mr. Ferguson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect to \n      benefit from the contribution of new medical products, improved \n      cross-sales of medical beds and support surfaces and our expectation of \n      slowly rising demand for capital goods in the medical markets we serve.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect lower sales of consumer bedding products for the remainder of \n      fiscal 2014 due to the previously reported loss of one of our large \n      retail customers that selected a different supplier in a routine \n      competitive bidding process for their everyday consumer bedding \n      products. We expect sales will continue to this customer through \n      February 2014 when they are expected to transition to their new supplier.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working closely with Hollander Home Fashions, our exclusive \n      marketing partner for consumer bedding products, to add new retail \n      customers. We expect the addition of new customers for our consumer \n      bedding products in fiscal 2014 should partially offset the sales lost \n      from the previous customer. In addition, we expect higher sales from our \n      industrial product lines due to the addition of new business as well as \n      growth from existing customers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concluded Ferguson.About Span-America Medical Systems, Inc.Span-America manufactures and markets a comprehensive selection of \n      pressure management products for the medical market, including \n      Geo-Matt\u00c2\u00ae, PressureGuard\u00c2\u00ae, Geo-Mattress\u00c2\u00ae, Custom Care\u00c2\u00ae, Span+Aids\u00c2\u00ae, \n      Isch-Dish\u00c2\u00ae, Risk Manager\u00c2\u00ae and Selan\u00c2\u00ae products.

We are\nrestructuring both these two portfolios with asset sales and\npotentially further write-downs,\" van Beurden said.The $15 billion of disposals targeted for this year and next\nwould be equivalent to around 6.5 percent of Shell's current\n$228 billion market capitalisation and compared to proceeds from\ndivestments of $1.7 billion in 2013.Amongst the assets Shell could put up for sale is its 23.1\npercent stake in Woodside Petroleum, which it owns from\nan abortive attempt to acquire the Australian oil and gas firm\nin 2001.

Mr. John added, \"Leading asset managers remain focused on strengthening their competitive position by driving innovation, automating key business processes and improving overall efficiencies to enhance their financial performance.\"Conducted duringBonaire'sannual client conferences inBostonandLondon, the survey looked at the top business objectives, individual objectives and challenges for the asset management industry.\u00c2The need for product innovation to differentiate in a crowded marketplace took the top spot among asset managers, with 34 percent of those surveyed noting this to be their biggest business objective.\u00c2\u00a0 Client retention, which has been at the top of the list for the past two years, was a close second with 32 percent of respondents indicating that as a priority. Compliance with new regulations was noted as a key challenge for the third year in a row as a result of the rapidly changing and increasing regulations, particularly in areas that require improved information management. Reducing costs and targeting new market segments also ranked high in importance.\u00c2When responding about their own individual team objectives, increased efficiency and accuracy was the clear winner with 62 percent of clients indicating it as their number one personal priority. \"This is reflective of industry efforts to move away from error-prone manual and point solutions in key areas such as finance and operations, sales and marketing, and compliance,\" added Mr. John. \"The move to automate manual processes also provides better transparency and intelligence in areas such as costs and sales trends.\"The most difficult challenge noted by respondents was the need to bring together holistic data from all business units and provide cross-business reporting. With 37 percent of voters citing cross-business reporting, they noted that a lack of enterprise-wide data and analytics can turn everyday tasks into time consuming exercises. Minimizing fee leakage and improving accuracy came in second with 31 percent noting that under- and/or over-charging of fees, inaccurate invoices and elongated billing cycles remain among the most important issues to address in order to improve the bottom line.When looking at solutions to help meet objectives and solve challenges, 92 percent of executives said implementing revenue and expense management solutions resulted in improvements in process and efficiency, with approximately 25 percent drawn by audit and compliance benefits and the reduction of fee leakage.\"Overall, leading asset managers are continuing to pursue opportunities to differentiate themselves, increase efficiency, and bring together the necessary enterprise-wide data and analytics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all while working to comply with an ever-changing regulatory environment.

The\nhedge fund had only 18 licence holders as of Jan. 29, the data\nshows.TWO TOUGH YEARSSegantii was founded by Simon Sadler, a former head of Asian\nequity trading for HSBC Securities, who is also the fund's chief\ninvestment officer.In 2008, when Asian hedge funds tumbled 20 percent,\nSegantii's hedge fund returned 23.8 percent, one of the few to\nmake money in the region when the global financial crisis wiped\nout hundreds of billions of dollars from the world markets.Investor interest in Segantii surged further after the fund\nscored its biggest gain of 40.75 percent in 2011 when the\nEurekahedge Asian index fell 7.4 percent, according to a\nnewsletter obtained by Reuters.Its assets more than doubled over the next two years but the\nhedge fund is yet to prove that it can continue generating\npre-2012 type returns with a larger asset base.The fund gained 4.8 percent in 2012 and lost 1.7 percent\nlast year when the Eurekahedge Asian index rose 9.8 percent and\n15.9 percent, respectively.\n\n (Reporting by Nishant Kumar; Editing by Michael Flaherty and\nEdwina Gibbs)"], "2014/01/30/idUSnGNX6nQK1G+1cd+GNW20140130": [0, "2014/01/30", "CONTACT: Media Contact:\n         Kevin Donovan\n         CFO\n         603-501-5240\n         kdonovan@bottomline.com"], "2014/01/30/research-and-markets-idUSnBw306050a+100+BSW20140130": ["Research and Markets: Biosimilars Market Report, 2018: Recombinant Non-glycosylated Proteins, Recombinant Glycosylated Proteins & Recombinant Peptides", "2014/01/30", "Research and Markets: Biosimilars Market Report, 2018: Recombinant \n      Non-glycosylated Proteins, Recombinant Glycosylated Proteins & \n      Recombinant PeptidesResearch and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/svdjqf/biosimilars) \n      has announced the addition of the\"Biosimilars \n      Market Report, 2018: Recombinant Non-glycosylated Proteins, Recombinant \n      Glycosylated Proteins & Recombinant Peptides\"report to \n      their offering.The global market is segmented on the basis of products, applications, \n      and services. By product, the global biosimilars market is segmented \n      into recombinant non-glycosylated proteins, recombinant glycosylated \n      proteins, and recombinant peptides. The recombinant non-glycosylated \n      proteins market is further classified into insulin, granulocyte \n      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon, and human growth hormone; \n      whereas the recombinant glycosylated proteins market is further broken \n      down into erythropoietin, monoclonal antibodies, and follitropin. \n      Glucagon and calcitonin are considered under the recombinant peptides \n      segment.The recombinant glycosylated proteins segment is the largest segment of \n      the market with a share of 40% of the global market in 2013. Of all the \n      products, monoclonal antibodies will be the fastest-growing segment at \n      an estimated CAGR of 41.9% from 2013 to 2018. Following this, insulin \n      will be the second-fastest growing market from 2013 to 2018. The growth \n      is attributed to the rise in incidences of diabetes; the ongoing patent \n      expiration of biologic drugs such as Lantus, Humalog, and Novorapid; and \n      the cost effectiveness of biosimilars of insulin.By application, the market is segmented into oncology, blood disorders, \n      growth hormonal deficiency, chronic and autoimmune disorders, and others \n      (female infertility, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, postmenopausal \n      osteoporosis, and chronic kidney failure). Oncology is the largest and \n      fastest-growing segment of the global biosimilars market.This is attributed to the increasing prevalence of oncology along with \n      the rise in aging population and the changing lifestyles. The global \n      market will be worth $2.0 billion by 2018, growing at a CAGR of 20.1% \n      during the forecast period (2013 to 2018). The major factors driving the \n      growth of the market are the launch of new biosimilars (monoclonal \n      antibodies, filgrastim, and follitropin); ongoing clinical research on \n      potential pipeline products; patent expirations of various biologics \n      such as Neupogen, Humira, and Lantus; and the increasing demand for \n      first-wave biosimilar products such as somatropin, filgrastim, and \n      erythropoietin.Scope of the ReportProduct- Recombinant Non-glycosylated Proteins-- Insulin-- Human Growth Hormone-- Granulocyte Colony--stimulating Factor (G--CSF)-- Interferons- Recombinant Glycosylated Proteins-- Erythropoietin-- Monoclonal Antibodies-- Follitropin- Recombinant Peptides-- Glucagon-- CalcitoninService- Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO)- Contract Research Organizations (CRO)- Others (Bioinformatics and Sales & Marketing Services)Application- Oncology- Blood Disorders- Chronic & Autoimmune Diseases- Growth Hormone Deficiency- Infectious Diseases- OthersKey Topics Covered:1 Introduction2 Executive Summary3 Premium Insights4 Market Overview5 Industry Analysis6 Global Biosimilars Market, By Product7 Global Biosimilars Market, By Application8 Global Biosimilars Service Market9 Geographic Analysis10 Competitive Landscape11 Company Profiles- Actavis, Inc- Amgen, Inc- Biocon Ltd- Celltrion, Inc- Cipla Ltd- Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd- Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd- Hospira, Inc- Lg Life Sciences Ltd- Merck Kgaa- Mylan, Inc- Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd- Roche Holding Ltd- Sandoz International GMBH (Division Of Novartis International Ag)- Stada Arzneimittel Ag- Synthon- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd- Wockhardt LtdFor more information visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/svdjqf/biosimilarsResearch and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comU.S. \n      Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716Sector:Biotechnology"], "2014/01/30/fujitsu-network-idUSnBw306098a+100+BSW20140130": ["Media Alert: Fujitsu Introduces Video Exploring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Next Leap in Optical Transport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<6702.T>", "2014/01/30", "Media Alert:Fujitsu Introduces Video Exploring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Next Leap \n      in Optical Transport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdLeading technology researcher and developer describes advances in \n      optical connectivity, including 400GFujitsu Network Communications Inc.:WHO:\u00c2\u00c2Dr. Jens Rasmussen, Director, Photonic Systems Labs at Fujitsu \n          Laboratories.\u00c2WHAT:Dr. Rasmussen explores the latest optical technology advances coming \n          to market.

Heinz Co.Concerns voiced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff were\ndetailed by the SEC in a court filing in New York federal court\nThursday as it seeks approval of a $5 million settlement with\ntwo brothers from Brazil.The SEC said that in November, Rakoff questioned the\nagency's decision to allow the brothers to settle while neither\nadmitting nor denying the charges. Despite a revision to the\nsettlement, the judge has continued to raise issues, the SEC\nsaid.The dispute, which has not been previously reported, came\ndespite a new settlement policy ushered in by SEC Chair Mary Jo\nWhite in June that would require defendants in some cases to\nmake admissions, in contrast to letting them resolve lawsuits\nwithout admitting or denying the charges.The shift followed a public debate over the practice\nprompted in large part by Rakoff, who in 2011 refused to approve\nthe SEC's $285 million financial crisis-related settlement with\nCitigroup Inc.Rakoff at the time said he had no way to know if the accord\nwas in the public interest. The SEC is awaiting a decision by\n2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on whether it will\nreverse the judge.The commission's latest run-in with Rakoff came in lawsuit\nfiled in February 2013 initially against unknown traders in H.K.\nHeinz over suspicious trades ahead of the announcement that the\nketchup maker would be acquired for $23 billion by Warren\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil's 3G\nCapital.In October, the SEC filed an amended complaint while\nsimultaneously settling with the two brothers in Brazil now\nnamed in the case, Michel Terpins and Rodrigo\nTerpins.The SEC said the brothers had used a family-owned Cayman\nIslands entity called Alpine Swift to buy $90,000 in options\npositions a day before the takeover was announced.After the deal became public, the positions' jumped in value\nby 2000 percent, the SEC said.As part of the settlement, the Terpins agreed to forfeit all\n$1.81 million in profits made from trading Heinz options and\nalso pay $3 million in penalties.Neither brother admitted nor denied the charges as part of\nthe settlement as initially drafted.No transcripts exist of the calls between Rakoff and the\nparties where the SEC said he raised his concerns. But from the\nstart, Rakoff's only concern was the inclusion of the no-admit,\nno-deny language, the SEC said.The SEC said that after further negotiations, it submitted\non Dec. 26 revised proposed consent judgments for Rakoff's\napproval that dropped the language. But the proposed judgments\ncontained clauses that made clear that the lack of the language\ndidn't constitute an admission, the SEC said.Rakoff on a Dec. 31 call expressed continued concerns and\ngave the parties three options, the SEC said: remove the new\nclauses, require the brothers to admit to the allegations for\nthe limited purpose of the proceedings, or have an evidentiary\nhearing.On a call that followed on Jan. 9, Rakoff ordered the SEC to\nsubmit a court filing providing the evidence supporting its\nclaims. Rakoff had required a similar filing in the Citigroup\ncase as well.In Thursday's filing, which provided that evidence, the SEC\nsaid the settlements with the brothers \"reflect a fair,\nadequate, and reasonable resolution of this matter.\"Dwight Bostwick, a lawyer for Michel Terpins, declined\ncomment. A lawyer for Rodrigo Terpins did not respond to a\nrequest for comment. A spokesman for the SEC also declined\ncomment.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

The deal\nsuspended some of the measures put in place since early 2012 in\nexchange for Iran curtailing its nuclear programme.The easing of the insurance sanctions for ships has been\nexpected by analysts to increase Iran's crude oil exports,\nalthough data from Tehran's largest customers - China, India,\nJapan and South Korea - has so far shown steady to lower\nshipments since the deal was signed in November.Uncertainty over post-July insurance payments, however, has\nmade the suspension of sanctions on ship cover \"of very limited,\nif any, value to shipowners,\" the group of shipping insurers\nsaid in a note this week.The International Group of P&I Clubs said it was uncertain\nif insurance claims that arose while sanctions are eased would\nbe honoured if they remained unpaid after July 20.The International Group has been in talks with the U.S.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control but OFAC has not been able to\nconfirm whether payments for claims could be made after July 20\nwhen sanctions could possibly be reimposed, the group said.\"Members should proceed on the basis that beyond 20 July\n2014 (or any extension of the initial six-month period), clubs\nwill not be able to respond to any claims presented in respect\nof liabilities arising during the 20 January-20 July suspension\nperiod,\" the group said in its note.The International Group represents 13 mutual protection and\nindemnity (P&I) clubs which cover about 90 per cent of the\nworld's ocean-going ships against claims for pollution, injury\nand cargo damage.P&I claims can take one or two years to settle, said a Japan\nP&I Club official. If claims cannot be settled within six months\nit would be similar to having no insurance, he said.He said owners of Japanese ships importing Iranian crude oil\nare staying with Tokyo's sovereign insurance scheme put in place\nin mid-2012 to keep the oil shipments flowing, and none have\nmoved to get cover from the Japan P&I Club.Shipowners \"are strongly recommended not to enter into\n contracts for transportation of crude oil,\npetroleum oil and petrochemical products\" without consulting\ntheir individual P&I insurers, the International Group said.It would continue to talk to the U.S. to clarify the\ninsurance issue, it added.\n\n (Additional reporting by Osamu Tsukimorni in TOKYO; Editing by\nTom Hogue)"], "2014/01/30/ca-ipc-nexusguard-idUSnPnPHnx3j8+160+PRN20140130": ["IPC and Nexusguard Team Up to Offer World-Class DDoS Defense with Localized Support to PH Enterprises", "2014/01/30", "SAN JOSE, Calif.,Jan. 30, 2014/PRNewswire/ --\u00c2\u00a0IPC\u00c2\u00ae (IP Converge Data Services, Inc.) today announced a partnership with Nexusguard, an industry-leading anti-DDoS services provider.\u00c2\u00a0 The partnership will see IPC providing frontline services to enterprise customers, helping them properly set up best-practice DDoS defense mechanisms and develop mitigation strategies.

Total assets as of December 31, 2013 were $891,930,000 compared to $875,340,000 as of December 31, 2012. Our net loan totals increased by $10,780,000 or 2% during the twelve months from December 31, 2012, and our deposits increased $5,263,000 or 1% during the same period. The Company's liquidity position remains strong with $263,988,000 in available for sale securities and $5,543,000 in interest earning deposits with other financial institutions.\"During the fourth quarter of 2013, The Bank's net interest income increased by $162,000 from the level achieved during the previous quarter. When you consider that our net loans declined by $5,821,000 during the quarter, our net interest income level remains pretty strong. New loan production during 2013 was near historical highs, but line usage by our customers of their credit lines remained muted and loan principal repayments were elevated well above the historical norm. All in all, for the full year ended December 31, 2013, the Bank added $10,780,000 in net loans and $5,263,000 in additional deposits. Considering that during 2013 we closed our office on the island of Guam, and consolidated three of our other branch office locations, we are pleased with these growth numbers. We are looking forward to expanding our Sunnyvale loan production office into a full service branch location during 2014. We believe our Sunnyvale location has significant growth potential, and the expansion of business conducted at this office will allow us to fully serve our customers in Sunnyvale and the surrounding Santa Clara county area,\" stated Tom McGraw, Chief Executive Officer.During the third quarter of 2012, FNB Bancorp acquired Oceanic Bank. The acquisition added approximately $103 million in new loans and $114 million in new deposits, and strengthened our presence in the San Francisco market. The transaction also allowed the Bank to record a bargain purchase gain of approximately $3.7 million. The full year 2012 statement of operations for 2012 includes the operations of Oceanic Bank from September 21, 2012 through December 31, 2012.\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2Financial Highlights: Fourth

Our 2012 acquisition of Oceanic Bank brought brokered Certificates of Deposit onto our balance sheet in volumes that we had not previously experienced. At December 31, 2012, our brokered deposits totaled $15,651,000. By December 31, 2013, we had reduced our brokered deposits to $4,905,000. At the same time, we were able to add to our demand and NOW account totals and our savings and money market totals.

I believe our company is well positioned to take full advantage of our presence in San Francisco and the peninsula and I am excited about those possibilities as we enter into 2014.

The sides also agreed that prisoners detained by police in the unrest should be granted amnesty although Yanukovich has made this conditional on protesters relinquishing control of all premises and roads they seized.In addition, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov resigned on Tuesday after a sharp escalation in street unrest and calls by the opposition for him to step down.The senior State Department said the U.S. was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the negotiations between the government and opposition.Discussions with Kerry would focus on ways to restore calm and relaunch the political process in Ukraine, including plans to form a new government, according to the official.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the opposition figures were attending the conference in Munich to discuss the situation in Ukraine with the international community.While in Germany, Kerry will also meet Germany's new Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday in Berlin followed by talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It is Kerry's first meeting with Merkel since leaked documents last year revealed Washington had been spying on EU citizens and bugged Merkel's mobile phone.Later in Munich Kerry will also meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov before being joined by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who has just led the first round of Syria talks in Geneva aimed at ending the country's three-year civil war.Kerry pressed Lavrov this week to step up pressure on Damascus to give up its chemical weapons. The United States on Thursday accused Syria of dragging its feet in giving up its chemical arsenal, saying that just 4 percent of its deadliest chemical agents had been shipped out of the country under a UN agreement.A meeting between Kerry and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is expected to focus on the next round of talks with Iran that could lead to a definitive settlement to a decade-old nuclear standoff. The talks between six world powers and Iran are expected to start within a few weeks.(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing byEric Walsh)"], "2014/01/30/idUSnMKWT2HJxa+1ec+MKW20140130": [0, "2014/01/30", "ARC Document Solutions Expects to Report Stronger Than Expected Fourth Quarter Sales and 2013 Revenue of Approximately $407 MillionWALNUT CREEK, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 30, 2014) - \u00c2\u00a0ARC Document Solutions, Inc.

The president is sleeping", "2014/01/31", "President Barack Obama is out of gas. Pooped out. Gone fishing. Or rather, golfing. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not that into it anymore. The republic is safe from any further vast left-wing legislative prescriptions for our ills.But Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing job fatigue is, paradoxically, cause for serious concern. While he sits back, aides in the White House and in the agencies are busy enacting a stealth agenda of rules and regulations. And on the world stage, Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal threatens national security.The president on display at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union is one who has shrunk from the pretension of becoming a president on the order of Ronald Reagan or Franklin Roosevelt into the purveyor of a list of puny policies that tinker at the margins.Instead of offering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and inspirational hope, Obama made increasing the minimum wage for federal contractors the centerpiece of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address. The increasingly disinterested president even had trouble pronouncing the name of his other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big idea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a limited savings vehicle the White House is calling a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MyRA.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdMajor issues like debt, deficit and entitlements? Fuhgetaboutit, way too much bother.Obama had entirely unremarkable tenures in both the Illinois and the U.S. Senate, angling almost immediately after entering each to move up. But now he has the same problem as lots of working stiffs. After five years in the same job, the thrill is gone \u2014 and the grunt work is to be avoided.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the State of the Union, but Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent golf excursion to Hawaii, that may serve as the template for the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proclaimed 2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153year of action.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdObama played nine times during his 15-day vacation. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, in a not insignificant indication of where his mind is at, he golfed 46 times in 2013 \u2014 easily an annual record for him as president and more than twice the 19 times he went out in 2012, when there was the serious work of getting reelected to be done.You will likely search in vain for a world leader who accomplished significant things in the same year he or she went golfing nearly four dozen times.For some perspective, President George W. Bush, who was known as a golfer, played only 24 times in more than two and a half years as president before stopping in October 2003, because he felt it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appropriate to play during wartime, according to White House chronicler Mark Knoller of CBS News.Obama and his advisers grieve to a sympathetic press that Republicans are to blame for the impasse in Congress. This even as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has become an oxymoron and the president touts his crowning left-wing achievement, Obamacare, which he jammed through Congress without convincing a single Republican \u2014 they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all be right-wing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremists\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u2014 to vote for it.A republic is intended to be a fractious form of government. Successful legislators, like Reagan and Bill Clinton, knew how to hold their own party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ranks while picking off enough of the opposition to pass laws.Obama was never particularly interested in building the relationships needed to curry favor, call in chits and twist arms. But now, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finished even pretending.He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going through any halfhearted motions \u2014 like he did last year, when he took some Republicans to dinner in awidely celebrated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reaching out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offensivethat ended almost immediately after it started. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear who Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close friends are on Capitol Hill now, or if he even has any \u2014 on either side of the aisle.As if to highlight the point, Obama recently brought back to the White House his former liaison to Congress, Phil Schiliro. But Schiliro won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be trying to pass new legislation. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working onimplementing the Affordable Care Actand beating back Republican attempts to undermine it.Republicans are interpreting Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vow to step up his use of executive orders as a play by a leftist president to undemocratically expand his power and unilaterally make policies he sees as inarguably enlightened. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right.But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the default position of a tired president who would rather have his aides come up with a policy than grind out something more important and far-reaching on Capitol Hill.So the hired help will do the work. An ever-vigorous John Podesta was brought in for at least a year, to see exactly how much legislation can be passed by the executive branch alone.Podesta is the perfect person for this job. As a former White House chief of staff for Clinton, heknows how to move both the White House and the agencies. He also created the Center for American Progress, a politically astute left-wing think tank that can serve up endless helpings of ideas for regulatory action.But Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effeteness is even less reassuring when it comes to foreign policy \u2014 where benign neglect can look like a dangerous abdication of duty.After failing to negotiate a U.S. military presence in Iraq, where al Qaeda is now snatching up real estate, Obama may be on course to do the same \u2014 or nearly the same \u2014 in Afghanistan.Having avoided seriously taking a side in Syria, Obama has now ceded diplomatic ground there to the Russians and allowed the festering battleground to become a new magnet and training ground forjihadists of several stripes.Most frightening is the possibility that Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-disengagement will lead to an Iranian nuclear weapon.Few have faith that Obama has the stomach for a war with Iran. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already dropped a longstanding U.S. demand, and acquiesced to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peaceful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iranian nuclear program. How can he be trusted not to embrace a flimsy final agreement that allows Iran to cheat its way into a nuclear weapon?Republicans should not be reassured by the passive new Obama. Because while he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleeping, his aides at home and U.S. enemies abroad will be filling in for him.PHOTO (TOP): President Barack Obama prepares to depart Andrews Air Force Base aboard Air Force One, in Maryland, January 29, 2014.

Last year he was promoted to run the company's\nfast-expanding cloud, or Internet-based, computing initiatives.His elevation to the top spot at Microsoft would end a\nfive-month search for a tech-savvy heavy-hitter to lead the\ncompany co-founded by Bill Gates. A source familiar with the\nmatter told Reuters on Thursday that Nadella's appointment was\nlikely, although the board had not yet met to finalise it.Nadella grew up in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, a\ntechnology hub that is home to the biggest Microsoft research\nand development centre outside of the United States.His father was a member of the elite Indian Administrative\nService and a member of the Planning Commission during 2004-2009\nunder Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. His father, B. N.\nYugandhar, who still lives in Hyderabad, declined to speak with\nReuters when reached by phone.Born in 1967, Nadella attended the prestigious Hyderabad\nPublic School, where he met his future wife. Nadella studied\nelectronics and communication engineering, at Manipal\nUniversity, where people who knew him at the time described him\nas friendly, modest and well-spoken.Manipal is a mid-ranking private institution, and does not\nhave the cachet of the elite Indian Institute of Technology\n(IIT) and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) where many of\nIndia's global power players were educated.GLOBAL INDIANIf he gets the top job at Microsoft, Nadella would join the\ngrowing list of Indian-born executives to head a major global\ncorporation. They already include PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra\nNooyi and Deutsche Bank co-CEO Executive Anshu Jain.After graduating in 1988, Nadella, like many ambitious\nIndians, moved to the United States to study, earning a master's\ndegree in computer science from the University of\nWisconsin-Milwaukee.Ganesh Prasad, a classmate of Nadella at Manipal who remains\nin touch with him, recalled a conversation in 1991 when Nadella\nwas working at Sun Microsystems.\"We were having a conversation and talking about Sun as the\nfuture of hardware ... and he was like: 'you know where I need\nto go? I need to be in software and I need to be in marketing\nand I need to be in Microsoft',\" Prasad recalled by phone from\nBangalore, where he now lives.Prasad, who worked for 20 years in the United States with\nIntel Inc, said Nadella started with a base in\ntechnology and then became interested in how to market it - a\nskill set that will be called upon in his new role.By comparison, Microsoft's previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, was\nregarded more as a salesman and cheerleader than a technology\nvisionary.\"While he comes from a very strong technology background,\nhis outlook over the years has changed to: 'so, what, what am I\ngoing to do with this thing? How do I position it? How do I make\nsense of it all?',\" said Prasad."], "2014/01/31/mexico-economy-idUSL2N0L50W520140131": ["UPDATE 2-Mexico cbank holds rate, eyes peso for any inflation impact", "2014/01/31", "By Gabriel Stargardter andChristine MurrayMEXICO CITYJan 31 (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank kept\ninterest rates on hold at a record low on Friday, as\npolicymakers seek to underpin a nascent recovery while keeping\nan eye on the country's currency, whose weakening could\ncontribute to accelerating inflation.The Banco de Mexico maintained its benchmark interest rate\n at 3.50 percent, as expected by analysts polled by\nReuters, after cutting rates in September and October to boost\ngrowth.In a statement announcing the interest rate decision, the\ncentral bank board said the Mexican peso's swings could increase\nthe risk of more inflation, which has breached the bank's target\nceiling.\"There is the possibility that a new period of increased\nvolatility in international financial markets could lead to a\ncurrency adjustment which could potentially affect inflation,\"\nit added.Mexico's annual inflation rate in mid-January shot up to\n4.63 percent, its fastest pace in eight months and well above\nthe central bank's upper policy limit of 4 percent.The bank said that while the rise in inflation was probably\ntemporary, it could not discount it having a more durable\nimpact.\"You cannot rule out the risk that the recent adjustments in\nrelative prices could lead to increases in medium-term inflation\nexpectations that could lead to second round effects,\" the bank\nstatement said.The Mexican peso  has weakened 2.8 percent\nthis month against the dollar as investor jitters mounted on a\nworldwide emerging markets sell-off.There was no mention of any possible rate adjustment in the\nstatement by the central bank, the Banco de Mexico (Banxico).But the central bank's stance raised questions if any\ninterest rate hike may come later this year.\"(The statement) is important because it means that maybe\nbecause of the volatility in the markets, in the FX markets,\nBanxico could move sooner than expected,\" said Nomura Securities\nsenior Latin America strategist Benito Berber, who noted the\nbank's \"neutral\" statement had \"a little bit of a hawkish\nflavor.\"\"It could be that they move, if volatility continues and the\neconomy grows, say in the second half of 2014,\" he added. \"What\nis even more interesting is that the (yield) curve is going\ndown, meaning that the market was positioned for an even more\nhawkish statement.\"Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens said in an\ninterview published this week the bank was weighing whether\nmonetary policy needs adjusting after a spike in inflation, but\nhe also expected the price surge to be temporary.Carstens said he expected food prices, a major component of\nthe consumer price index gauge and which have recently risen, \nto correct during this year, while other prices linked to fiscal\npolicy would correct within a year. He also suggested a rate\nhike would not help correct current price pressures.In a Reuters poll last week, the median of analysts surveyed\nprojected the central bank will raise its benchmark rate to 3.75\npercent in the first quarter of 2015, pushing back expectations\nfor a hike in the second half of this year in the previous poll.\"Overall I see no indication of a near-term or a short-term\nchange in monetary policy, but they remain vigilant if things\ndeteriorate from here,\" said Alberto Ramos, senior Latin America\neconomist at Goldman Sachs in New York, adding that he expects\nan interest rate hike to come toward the end of 2014.Following aggressive hikes by South Africa and Turkey this\nweek, yields on Mexican short-term interest rate swaps \nrose sharply to price in a rate rise as soon as July\n.Mexico's central bank lowered borrowing costs in September\nand October after an economic contraction in the second quarter\nand policymakers have been expected to keep borrowing costs\nsteady amid a tepid recovery in U.S. demand for Mexican exports."], "2014/02/01/us-usa-military-missile-idUSBREA1001C20140201": ["Pentagon to further study four possible East Coast missile defense sites", "2014/02/01", "WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department said on Friday it would conduct environmental impact studies for four possible missile defense sites in the eastern United States but stressed it had not yet decided to proceed with construction.Congress, worried about Iran's efforts to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, is urging the Pentagon to commit to an East Coast site. Defense officials say current interceptors on the West Coast can defend the country against possible missile attacks, and an extra interceptor site would add enormous costs to a military budget already under pressure.Still, Pentagon officials are proceeding with the environmental impact study required under a directive in the 2013 defense authorization bill. In a statement issued Friday, the department said it would take about two years to complete a comprehensive environmental impact study, which will look at potential impacts to land use, water resources, air quality, transportation, socioeconomics and other factors.The four sites are Fort Drum, New York; SERE Training Area at Naval Air Station, Portsmouth, Maine; Camp Ravenna Joint Training Center in Ohio; and Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan.A fifth possible site - Camp Ethan Allen Training Site in Vermont that had been identified in September - was dropped from the list of sites to be studied further. It was not immediately clear why it was dropped.U.S. lawmakers, worried about the ability of West Coast missile defense sites to protect against all possible missile threats, have pressed the Pentagon to consider adding sites in the eastern half of the country.The 2013 defense authorization law required U.S. officials to identify three possible interceptor sites, including at least two on the East Coast.Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, said selection of the four sites marked an important step forward, but urged the Obama administration to speed up work on the environmental impact statement (EIS), given Iran's reported continued work to develop long-range missiles.\"In light of the fact that Iran may have an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of striking the continental United States as early as next year, I call on the administration to expedite the EIS and move without delay to build a missile defense interceptor site on the east coast of the United States,\" she said in a statement.Riki Ellison with the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the United States faced other more pressing missile defense needs than creation of a new interceptor site, including a redesign of the part of the rocket that is used to hit enemy missiles and destroy them on impact.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester recommended work on a new \"kill vehicle\" in a report this week.Kingston Reif, with the nonprofit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, noted that the Congressional Budget Office had estimated that it would cost about $3.5 billion over the next five years to build a third interceptor site.\"This is money the Pentagon does not have and does not want to use for this purpose,\" he said.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Editing byKen Wills)"], "2014/01/31/research-and-markets-idUSnBw315426a+100+BSW20140131": ["Research and Markets: The Revenue Drill - Squeezing the most out of 2G & 3G Networks: LTE Subscriber Base to Cross 1 Billion by End of 2018", "2014/01/31", "Research and Markets: The Revenue Drill - Squeezing the most out of \n      2G & 3G Networks: LTE Subscriber Base to Cross 1 Billion by End of 2018Research and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zc9lgr/the_revenue_drill) \n      has announced the addition of the\"The \n      Revenue Drill - Squeezing the most out of 2G & 3G Networks\"report to their offering.Unfolding the new revenue opportunities around 2G/ 3G, strategies for \n      maximising profits from mobile broadband opportunity, portfolio planning \n      for growth via new revenue verticals, realistic and profitable \n      strategies for harnessing VoIP and IP messaging uptake, latest trends in \n      network management and pricing models, and much more...Key Findings:- 2G still accounts for 70% of connections globally, however, 2G \n      connections will continue to decline in the coming years with the \n      growing penetration of smartphone and tablets, and users' migration to \n      next-generation networks.

The current focus is standards-compliant messaging to allow \n      hospitals to swiftly, easily and safely collect and transmit data to \n      public health entities.Additionally, OZ Systems continued its important dialogue with leaders \n      in Public Health, highlighting the still new screening forCritical \n      Congenital Heart Disease(CCHD), itsNewborn \n      Admission Notification Information(NANI) messaging and Early \n      Hearing Care Plan (EHCP) for the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Early Hearing Detection and \n      Intervention (EHDI) \n      program.

I'm not on Facebook and I never will be,\" said Church during an interview in a Nashville studio.Instead, the 36-year-old singer is going back to music basics to engage fans with videos to accompany the intimate, often melancholic love songs from his new album, \"The Outsiders,\" due to be released on February 11.The videos for the new songs will be connected by recurring characters and themes, which Church said would come together into one story as each installment is released.\"We know what the singles are going to be, so we've conceived and conceptualized what these videos will be,\" Church said. \"Everybody you see in the 'Hometown' video has a story line that relates to each other.\"From the heyday of MTV in the 1980s and 1990s to YouTube, music videos have long been used to popularize songs.It is rare, however, for an artist, especially in country music, to create videos that will become a mini-movie of an album.\"I wanted something more compelling to give my fans than just the music,\" Church said. \"I think creatively and artistically, there are broader story lines here. I thought it would add some intrigue and fun to carry these videos throughout the album and give the fans a way to be involved.\"The only video to be released so far is for \"Give Me Back My Hometown,\" in which Church sings at a barren graveyard while a funeral for a woman takes place. Flashbacks throughout the video offer glimpses into how she may have died.\"The further we get into this the more you're going to be able to look back and see how many clues we gave you to see just where this is going,\" Church teased.A DARKER SOUND\"The Outsiders\" follows Church's 2011 album \"Chief,\" which catapulted the North Carolina singer into mainstream country music with hits such as \"Springsteen\" and \"Drink in My Hand.\" The 11 tracks were dedicated to partying.For \"The Outsiders,\" Church said he knew he had to embrace a mature sound.\"When we started this album, I knew I was at a point in my career where I had two choices. I could continue to do songs like 'Drink in My Hand,' 'Springsteen' and 'Creepin,' or I could make a conscious effort to challenge myself and do something that was artistic,\" he said.\"The Outsiders\" was recorded in a renovated church in East Nashville that is now used as a studio by the singer's producer Jay Joyce.The album's namesake lead single is a rock-heavy anthem evoking the journey the singer has traveled from his rebellious past. The second single, \"Give Me Back My Hometown,\" is a dark tune of lost love and loneliness.\"If you are going to be a relevant artist, it is up to you to carry that artistic flag and do something with it,\" Church said of the direction for the new album.\"I don't know how it's going to be received. I don't know that I care. Creatively we are trying to be relevant with our music.\"\"Chief\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, a surprise because he did not have a big radio hit at the time, said Keith Caulfield, Billboard's associate director of charts and retail.The unexpected debut demonstrated the strength of the fan base Church developed over the years, Caulfield said, adding that Church \"is in a really good spot\" to enter high on the Billboard 200 chart with \"The Outsiders.\"In today's world of digital song downloads surpassing overall album sales as listeners pick and choose the tracks they want, Church said he has made an album with a beginning and an end, and a carefully designed order of songs.\"It's going to aggravate me a lot if people hit Shuffle when they listen to this album.

The comment period on the proposed rules ends on Friday.That decision \"will rob financial institutions of a very safe source of liquidity and prevent institutions from using municipal bonds to diversify their portfolios,\" Janet Cowell, North Carolina's treasurer, wrote in a comment letter on the proposed rule.\"This will increase borrowing costs, leading to increased taxes and rates for citizens and delayed or foregone capital projects,\" Cowell said.Several cities and towns in North Carolina filed similar comments, as did leaders from Houston; Junction City, Kansas; and Washington County, Pennsylvania.Ratings agency Fitch said on Thursday that U.S. banks held about $404 billion in outstanding municipal securities and loans, and the proposed rules could cause them to reduce those holdings.\"It would be more expensive for banks to hold municipal bonds on their balance sheets and therefore banks that also serve as dealers may become hesitant to provide liquidity in the secondary market using proprietary capital, increasing liquidity risk for municipal bond holders,\" the agency said.The proposed liquidity rules are meant to respond to experiences during the crisis, when some banks had significant assets but did not have enough cash on hand to survive runs.Banks with $250 billion or more in assets, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, must meet the full requirement, while mid-sized banks face a less stringent liquidity requirement.Regulators want U.S. banks to meet the new requirements two years before most foreign banks must comply, and they also excluded covered bonds and private-label mortgage securities from the liquid asset buffer.Further, they created a new method for calculating how much liquid assets banks need that would likely mean U.S. banks would have to hold more than foreign banks would.In comment letters filed with the regulators, several big banks said these extra requirements go too far.\"The U.S. proposal includes a number of new operational requirements ... that introduce uncertainties and unnecessary burdens,\" wrote Gregory Hackworth, Bank of America Corp's treasurer.(Editing byMohammad Zargham)"], "2014/01/31/markets-canada-stocks-idUSL2N0L50ZW20140131": ["CANADA STOCKS-TSX drops on emerging-market fears, economic data", "2014/01/31", "* TSX falls 119.12 points, or 0.87 percent, to 13,616.16\n    * All of the 10 main index sectors decline\n    * TransCanada steady ahead of Keystone pipeline review\n    * CN Rail slips after quarterly report\n\n    By John Tilak\n    TORONTO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell\nsharply on Friday as persisting concerns about emerging markets,\ncoupled with mixed economic data out of Europe and the United\nStates, fueled declines in every major sector.\n    Investors also had an eye on TransCanada Corp,\nwhose shares were little changed, ahead of a U.S. environmental\nreview of its proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline that is likely\nto say the project will not appreciably increase carbon\nemissions. \n    Data from the euro zone showed inflation fell in January,\nmissing market expectations and coming below the European\nCentral Bank's target. \n    Separate figures indicated that U.S. consumer spending rose\nmore than expected in December, but weak income growth suggested\nthe world's biggest economy could cool off in the first quarter.\n \n    Global markets have had a turbulent ride in recent days as\nvolatility in some emerging market currencies and doubts about\nthe pace of China's economic growth has hit investor sentiment\nhard.

That's why law enforcement agencies through the area are focusing on getting impaired drivers off the road. Highway safety officials, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Techniques for Effective Alcohol Management (TEAM) Coalition and the National Football League (NFL), have joined forces to remind everyone to designate a sober driver.Impaired driving carries the possibility of fines, increased insurance rates, jail time, injury and death. It's simply not worth the risk. Law enforcement throughout the area, will be on the lookout for impaired drivers and reminds you that if you are found to be impaired, you will be arrested.According to NHTSA, in 2011,9,878 people were killed in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes. These crashes were 31 percent more likely to occur on weekends than on weekdays.*Whether attending the game, watching at a bar or hosting a party, remember thatFans Don't Let Fans Drive Drunk.Before choosing to drink, choose your team's MVP -- a sober designated driver. NHTSA offers these additional safety tips:If you're attending a Super Bowl party or watching the game at a sports bar or restaurant:Designate your sober driver, or plan another way to get home safely before the party begins.If you don't have a designated driver, then ask a sober friend for a ride home; call a cab, friend, or family member to come and get you; or just stay for the night.Use your community's sober ride program.If you're hosting a Super Bowl party:Make sure all your guests designate a sober driver in advance, or arrange for alternate transportation to ensure they get home safely.Serve food and include non-alcoholic beverages at the party.Stop serving alcohol at the end of the third quarter of the game and begin serving coffee and dessert.Keep the numbers for local cab companies handy, and take the keys away from anyone who has had too much to drink.And remember, your seat belt is your best defense against a drunk driver in a crash.*Note: Weekend - Friday 6 p.m. to Monday 5:59 a.m.For more information, please visitTrafficSafetyMarketing.gov.CONTACT:Ginny Vineyard816-456-5302Email ContactReuters.namespace(\"info\");\n\tReuters.info.outbrain_env = 'produsx';window._taboola = window._taboola || [];\n    _taboola.push({mode:'organic-text-links-2c', container:'taboola-bmc', placement:'bmc', target_type:'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];\n  _taboola.push({mode:'thumbs-2r', container:'taboola-below-main-column', placement:'below-main-column'});var headlineEncoded = 'Drunk+Driving+Means+Costly+Penalties';\n    var currentId = 'USnMKW7n8gWa+1c2+MKW20140131';\n    var storyChannel = 'pressRelease';\n    var storyEdition = 'BETAUS';\n    var storyURL = 'www.reuters.com';\n    var socialCommentCount = '5';Comments (0)This discussion is now closed.

That's what makes the Washington game really frustrating.\"The wins on the homestand came against teams with the second-best record (Portland) and fourth-best record in the Western Conference.\"We need to figure out a way to play like we did tonight and like we did against Portland more consistently,\" said Lee, who shared game-high scoring honors for the Warriors, finishing with 22 points. \"We've got to bring it to Utah (on Friday night).\"All-Star point guard Stephen Curry (22 points) joined Lee and four other Warriors in double figures. Golden State got 29 points from the league's least productive bench while easily disposing of a tired Clippers club.\"What I liked about tonight was that we set the tone early and battled,\" Warriors coach Mark Jackson said. \"That's a pretty good basketball team with a lot of weapons. That was a quality win for us.\"Shooting guard Klay Thompson (16 points), center Andrew Bogut (14), backup big man Marreese Speights (12) and reserve forward Harrison Barnes (10) made solid contributions for the Warriors.Bogut (17 rebounds) and Lee (11) both recorded double-doubles.\"It hasn't been a happy place around here,\" Bogut said. \"A lot of guys are edgy right now, not in great moods because we haven't been playing good basketball. We responded well.\"The Clippers (33-16) won each of their previous four games, but they did so over a six-day stretch leading into Thursday's contest.They had one big run in them in their fifth game in seven nights, cutting a 54-35 deficit to 62-56 shortly before halftime. Shooting guard J.J. Redick sank two 3-pointers in the comeback.The Clippers, down by eight at the half, came back from the break as flat as they were to start the game, watching Golden State run off to a 90-67 lead from which Los Angeles could not recover. The visitors missed 14 of 15 shots in the third period.\"We couldn't make a shot,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \"It was one of those nights. Bad night for us, good night for Golden State.\"Redick had the Clippers' only basket of the third quarter, a 3-pointer that came 6:23 into the period. Getting six points from Lee, the Warriors turned a 64-56 halftime advantage into an 80-58 blowout by that point.\"It was a tough game coming into it. We knew that,\" Rivers said of the busy schedule. \"I told the coaches before (the Washington game on Wednesday) that if we can win one of these two, I'd be very happy. We just didn't have it. We had nothing.\"The Clippers beat the Wizards 110-103 on Wednesday at Staples Center.All-Star power forward Blake Griffin had 27 points Thursday for the Clippers, who lost for the 15th time in their past 17 visits to Oakland. Griffin scored 20 of his points in the first half.Point guard Darren Collison added a season-high 22 points, and Redick scored 12 on four 3-pointers in the losing effort. Center DeAndre Jordan grabbed 20 rebounds to complement nine points.The game featured none of the extracurriculars that marred Golden State's 105-103 home win over the Clippers on Christmas night. That contest included two ejections, two flagrant fouls and three technical fouls.The Warriors never trailed Thursday, jumping out to an 11-point lead in the first quarter behind a combined 16 points and 10 rebounds from frontcourt mates Lee and Bogut.Golden State's reserves, led by Barnes, Speights and guard Jordan Crawford, contributed 18 second-quarter points as the Warriors built as much as a 19-point lead.Los Angeles got as close as six before halftime but never closer than eight in the second half.NOTES: Los Angeles PF Blake Griffin was held to a season-low three rebounds as the Clippers lost the battle of the boards 53-34. ... Clippers C DeAndre Jordan (.647) and Warriors C Andrew Bogut (.640) began the night Nos. 1 and 2 in the league in field-goal percentage, and each improved his mark. Jordan went 3-for-4, Bogut 7-for-11. ... Bogut recorded three blocked shots, his sixth consecutive game with at least two. ... Clippers PG Chris Paul was selected by the coaches to be among the seven Western Conference All-Star reserves for the Feb. 16 game in New Orleans. Paul currently is out of action with a separated shoulder. ... The Warriors are assured of having at least two representatives in New Orleans. PG Stephen Curry was voted by the fans into a starting spot for the West in the All-Star Game, while reserve SF Harrison Barnes was picked to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge on Feb. 14."], "2014/01/31/ny-fitch-ratings-bac-idUSnBw315908a+100+BSW20140131": ["Fitch: NY Approval of Mortgage Settlement Positive for BAC", "2014/01/31", "Fitch: NY Approval of Mortgage Settlement Positive for BACToday's decision by a New York State Supreme Court judge to approve the \n      terms of a settlement between private-label mortgage securitization \n      investors and Bank of America (BAC) is positive for the bank's credit \n      profile, if not successfully appealed with respect to loan \n      modifications, according to Fitch Ratings. The settlement removes a \n      substantial source of uncertainty from BAC's remaining contingent \n      liabilities, though future appeals are possible.BAC is fully reserved for the $8.5 billion settlement (in addition to \n      $100 million for legal and administration fees). Following this \n      settlement, BAC faces remaining litigation exposure in New York and \n      California related to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \n      private-label securitization (PLS) claims. However, BAC is now better \n      positioned to fund future litigation losses.In a prior special report, we estimated that the remaining FHFA \n      litigation losses for BAC could total between $5 billion and $8 billion. \n      With today's settlement complete, we think the FHFA losses can be \n      managed by the bank within the context of current expectations for \n      earnings and capital ratios.The judge ruled that the 2011 settlement between investors, BAC and \n      trustee Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) should be upheld, noting that BNY \n      acted in good faith. We believe that the approval of the settlement \n      likely reflected, in part, the fact that litigants had dropped \n      objections given improving PLS performance over the past two years as \n      the housing market has begun to recover.While the approval of the settlement is a positive for BAC, there is no \n      impact on current ratings. Longer-term ratings momentum will be \n      predicated on meaningful and sustained earnings improvement, capital \n      ratios that compare more favorably with large bank peers and a continued \n      wind-down of legacy litigation liabilities and impaired assets.The above article originally appeared as a post on the Fitch Wire credit \n      market commentary page.
